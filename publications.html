						<p class="abstract">
							The STEM Career Infographic Project (SCIP) was a 4-week exploratory project deployed in an 8th grade classroom at Mountain Vista 
							Middle School (MVMS).  SCIP was poised to address the growing focus on STEM fields at MVMS and within the school district.  We 
							piloted SCIP in Spring 2014 with six science classes or about 180 students.  SCIP allowed for students to explore their own STEM 
							interests, while simultaneously engaging in the 6 Computational Thinking Practices (CTP) outlined by the College Board.
						</p>
						<p class="abstract">
							Students were required to research a STEM career in-depth, then report on their careers using infographics (CTP #2: Creating 
							Computational Artifacts and CTP #3: Abstracting).  We used free and online programs to create the infographics; this provided the 
							students the opportunity to learn software they were not previously exposed to and to explore new communication tools (CTP #1: 
							Connecting Computing and CTP #2: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts).  SCIP also provided many occasions for the students to work 
							together by sharing career information or helping each other with the software (CTP #6: Collaborating).  At the end of the project 
							the students presented their infographics in front of the class and taught their classmates about their career (CTP #5: Communicating).
						</p>
						<p class="abstract">
							The project was incredibly successful.  The students had a positive affect through the duration of the project and many also expressed 
							an extreme level of interest in doing similar projects in the future.  We will be repeating this project in Spring 2015, with a few 
							adaptations and formal evaluation scheme.

						<p class="abstract">
							The STEM Career Infographic Project (SCIP) was a 5-week exploratory project deployed in an 8th grade classroom at Mountain Vista 
							Middle School (MVMS) in the spring of 2014. Students were required to research a STEM career in-depth, then report on their careers 
							using infographics, in lieu of a standard 5-paragraph essay. SCIP was broken down into 9 days of instruction: introduction, research, 
							three days of design lecture, three work days, and a final presentation day. The students were in the lab working on their infographics 
							every day. We observed that infographics were better suited than traditional essays in areas that involved creativity and visual 
							appeal, limited writing for ESL (English as a Second Language) students, fostering and appealing to student’s interests, and overall 
							student enjoyment. Some of the negative obstacles we encountered revolved around limitations of free and online software, addressing 
							the learning curve of technology, and altering student’s expectations of reporting tools. Overall, we considered SCIP a success because 
							of the positive affect we recognized in the students through the duration of the project.
