Gender inequality recognizes boys.
(quote from article)

That's very true.Especially in 3rd world countries. When i was at University. I did notice there are lots of girls and very few boys.
I did read some studies that said: only between 1% to 3% of Pupils are able to go to University in Morocco
So from every 100 kids started their primary school only between 1 to 3 of them can make it to university. Most of boys drop early looking to earn money, by working bad jobs or by joining the army.
The saddest thing i noticed when i was at my Uni. I did notice that 80% of campus students are females. I have a female friend on my class, she lives in the campus. Sometimes, on my way to university, i meet her going to campus to sleep bcs she use partying all night somewhere else until the morning and then she go to sleep in a free state campus while me i did rent and pay for the landlord bcs i didn't have free campus.even if i wanted the campus.
I did talk to one of my friends, about her, bcs i saw her many times in a sleepy looks at Amphitheater. And did saw her twice in the morning going toward the campus instead of going to university in the early morning.
My friend, told me, the campus is full of prostitute girls, there are girls that live there for years and never went went to University daily like you.
I decided to go to see the campus sometimes after i leave my University at 6:15PM. I did really saw guys with fancy cars from Europe picking up girls front of Campus's big Doors.
At that momment, i felt bad, because i do know lots of guys left University because they can't afford renting. While a free State Campus is full of Prostitute girls .","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1/12-0-44 SAVE/antiFeminist-MensRights/UN_Gender_Equality_Report_Reco/UN_Gender_Equality_Report_Reco___COMMENTS.html","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1/12-0-44 SAVE/antiFeminist-MensRights/UN_Gender_Equality_Report_Reco/UN_Gender_Equality_Report_Reco___LINK.html","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1/12-0-44 SAVE/antiFeminist-MensRights/UN_Gender_Equality_Report_Reco","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1/12-0-44 SAVE/antiFeminist-MensRights","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1/12-0-44 SAVE","data/data_collection/16-10-04 v1",antiFeminist-MensRights,"12-0-44 SAVE","16-10-04 v1"
