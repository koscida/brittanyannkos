To get into the Apollo program it was a question all the requirements that you met, like academics, flying time and being a test pilot. Once in the program, dedication to learning everything you could, doing everything right and not playing office politics were the important things, as far as I was concerned. I was an engineer by training and a test pilot by vocation and I very quickly got into projects that required those particular skills.</p><figure name="771b" id="771b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 708px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 101.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dtiNJ6l-w1PbTfruVsyu0w.jpeg" data-width="2500" data-height="2529" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*dtiNJ6l-w1PbTfruVsyu0w.jpeg" draggable="false" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dtiNJ6l-w1PbTfruVsyu0w.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="5f01" id="5f01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Everyone who was in the program was very individualistic. Very hard-driving people that were going to grab all the training they could get, and they had to do everything on their own. If it may not have been for the space program, it could have been for other things like being a test pilot in the Air Force. But once they got assigned to a mission crew then they molded themselves into a team of three people to go to the Moon.</p><figure name="f099" id="f099" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mB1o92tAbyWRaEai3oAK4Q.jpeg" data-width="4391" data-height="4391" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*mB1o92tAbyWRaEai3oAK4Q.jpeg" draggable="false" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mB1o92tAbyWRaEai3oAK4Q.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="b463" id="b463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Once in the program we all had to apply ourselves hard to all the things we had to learn about space, how to navigate and how to fly a spacecraft.

We had a goal of getting to and back from the Moon and everybody worked to it. Everybody was focused on the goal and nobody was trying to protect their job — they were all trying hard to get the job done even beyond the highest standards, no matter how “small” their role in the program. Most of the people working in the Apollo program were young, with a average age of 28, and that helped a lot in overcoming all sorts of engineering challenges, because they did not “know” that something was impossible.</p><figure name="74d2" id="74d2" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="/media/37664c8417dda1de1a7ccc2fd2375edd?maxWidth=700" data-media-id="37664c8417dda1de1a7ccc2fd2375edd" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="0d6b" id="0d6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We also had a fantastic design advantage in Wernher von Braun and his team that put together the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Apollo spacecraft.

In an airplane you can go up with an instructor and he can show you all the things that an airplane can do and he coaches you through how to fly an airplane, in the real thing. With a spacecraft you don’t have that ability to just get in and fly that thing around a little bit, so you’ve got to do it in a simulator. Simulation is the only way you can learn how to really fly that thing. Our simulator was absolutely perfect. It did everything that we would see in flight: all the visuals, all the noise, the mechanicals, the computer, the navigation; everything in the simulator worked exactly like it would in the flight. And it really trained us for the flight because once we were in the flight it was sort of like doing the simulation all over again.</p><figure name="9ce9" id="9ce9" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="640" data-height="480" width="640" height="480" src="/media/00c6fde0ae4f9bfd65ee630196491a9e?maxWidth=640" data-media-id="00c6fde0ae4f9bfd65ee630196491a9e" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="e5ad" id="e5ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avi</strong>: What made the Saturn V so special?<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Al</strong>: The Saturn V was an absolutely wondrous machine: it made 7.5 million pounds of thrust just to get itself off the ground. It’s the largest machine that’s ever been built. It was designed from the ground up by the people at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama where Wernher von Braun oversaw the design and the buildup of the Saturn V.</p><figure name="a0aa" id="a0aa" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="640" data-height="480" width="640" height="480" src="/media/ec8eb0f46e764a8e98ec87dffc6f0824?maxWidth=640" data-media-id="ec8eb0f46e764a8e98ec87dffc6f0824" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="8a52" id="8a52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was early in the space business and all the engines on the Saturn V were liquid fuel engines. Liquid fuel engines are more complicated than solid boosters but they have some attributes that solids don’t have. In fact, we could start and stop some of the liquid engines in space, which you can’t do with a solid engine. The Saturn V engines also had an attribute called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">center line thrust</em>: the engines were stacked close enough together at the base of the launch vehicle so that if you lost one the others could tilt slightly to take over for that one engine. As a matter of fact on one of the flights they lost the center engine and they just kept on going, it just took them a little longer to get into orbit but everything was fine.

The reason it’s kind of important is that it reminds you— as you’re looking at that picture and trying to figure out what’s there, that the Earth, seen from the Moon, goes through the same phases that the Moon does seen from the Earth.</p><figure name="caed" id="caed" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 50%;"></div><div class="iframeContainer"><IFRAME data-width="480" data-height="240" width="480" height="240" src="/media/f26c7b68814cfcf5060f1b27b956e538?maxWidth=480" data-media-id="f26c7b68814cfcf5060f1b27b956e538" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></IFRAME></div></div></figure><p name="ad2c" id="ad2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avi</strong>: It makes you relate more deeply to Earth as a solar body.<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Al</strong>: I think so, too, because when you see a crescent, it is caused by the angle of the Sun at the time you looked at it. So, it’s not just some artificial thing out there, it’s a real, living Earth that goes around the Sun, just as the Moon goes around the Earth. If you stayed on the near side of the Moon for 28 days, you’d see the Earth in all of its phases.</p><figure name="c3ef" id="c3ef" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 403px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 57.599999999999994%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5tEq1bMNyfB-9T8wS98-oQ.jpeg" data-width="2048" data-height="1180" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*5tEq1bMNyfB-9T8wS98-oQ.jpeg" draggable="false" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5tEq1bMNyfB-9T8wS98-oQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.noao.edu/education/peppercorn/pcmain.html" data-href="http://www.noao.edu/education/peppercorn/pcmain.html" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Thousand Yard Model or The Earth as a Peppercorn</a></figcaption></figure><p name="4910" id="4910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avi</strong>: What it implies is that we don’t have a really good grasp of the relationship of all the bodies in the Solar System or even our relation to the Sun, which we see every day.<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Al</strong>: I agree. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Ob0xR0Ut8" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Ob0xR0Ut8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">I don’t think we truly understand the scale and scope of the Solar System</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZx3U0dbASg" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZx3U0dbASg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Sun is 1.3 million times bigger than the Earth</a>.

The problem with us humans is that we’re pretty impatient. We like to have something that we dream up and see it happen within our lifetimes. We don’t really think much in longer terms. We’re developing new capabilities and procedures over time. We’re developing new propulsion systems. And all this kind of stuff, when it comes to fruition, might allow us to go to that planet which is 4.3 light years away. But that means we have to develop a propulsion system that’s going to take us out there pretty close to the speed of light.

You get your correct attitude by doing star sightings, you get two stars, and you force them together, and then the computer calculates the angle. Anyway, then you have to do an Earth, horizon and star sighting to find your place in the Earth-Moon system, and the angle is critical to that. Well, the problem is that the atmosphere is 50 miles thick. So, if you just do a sighting on the whole atmosphere, you could be off by 50 miles, which could probably kill you when you come back.</p><figure name="8351" id="8351" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 483px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 69.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*rcrBzJ7piXuv5Gu8Tv94cg.jpeg" data-width="1500" data-height="1036" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*rcrBzJ7piXuv5Gu8Tv94cg.jpeg" draggable="false" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rcrBzJ7piXuv5Gu8Tv94cg.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/apollo-sextant-and-eye-piece" data-href="https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/apollo-sextant-and-eye-piece" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow">Apollo Sextant and Eye Piece</a></figcaption></figure><p name="1a55" id="1a55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So, what I had to do was find a color band in the horizon, in the atmosphere.
