                  <b>1350 BCE</b><br>
                  One of the earliest written records of a urine-based pregnancy 
                  test can be found in an ancient Egyptian document. A papyrus 
                  described a test in which a woman who might be pregnant could 
                  urinate on wheat and barley seeds over the course of several 
                  days: &#8220;If the barley grows, it means a male child. If 
                  the wheat grows, it means a female child. If both do not grow, 
                  she will not bear at all.&#8221; Testing of this theory in 1963 
                  found that 70 percent of the time, the urine of pregnant women 
                  did promote growth, while the urine of non-pregnant women and 
                  men did not. Scholars have identified this as perhaps the first 
                  test to detect a unique substance in the urine of pregnant women, 
                  and have speculated that elevated levels of estrogens in pregnant 
                  women&#8217;s urine may have been the key to its success. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Middle Ages through the Seventeenth Century</b><br>
                  Using visual aspects of urine to detect pregnancy became a popular 
                  method. In Europe, so-called &#8220;piss prophets&#8221; claimed 
                  to be able to diagnose many different conditions and diseases 
                  by the color of urine. In a 1552 text, pregnancy urine was described 
                  as: &#8220;clear pale lemon color leaning toward off-white, 
                  having a cloud on its surface.&#8221; Other tests included mixing 
                  wine with urine and observing the results. Indeed, alcohol reacts 
                  with certain proteins in urine, so this may have had a moderate 
                  success rate.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Nineteenth Century</b><br>
                  Various theories abounded, such as the possibility that pregnancy 
                  urine contained certain identifiable crystals or bacteria. Scientists 
                  did not know enough about pregnancy to develop a reliable test. 
                  However, for sexually active women, the best method for diagnosing 
                  pregnancy remained careful observation of their own physical 
                  signs and symptoms (such as morning sickness).<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1890s</b><br>
                  Many physicians began to describe the workings of chemicals 
                  in the body, suggesting that &#8220;internal secretions&#8221; 
                  by certain organs were crucial to an understanding of human 
                  biology. Ernest Starling named these chemical messengers &#8220;hormones.&#8221;<br>
                  <br>
                  American public health advocates started to encourage women 
                  to see their doctors as soon as possible after pregnancy was 
                  suspected. Prenatal care was found to improve the health of 
                  both infants and mothers, even though most women would not see 
                  a doctor or midwife until well into the pregnancy.<br>

                  <b>1903</b><br>
                  Research on human reproduction intensified in the early twentieth 
                  century. Ludwig Fraenkel described the corpus luteum, the glandular 
                  mass that forms in women&#8217;s bodies during the normal menstrual 
                  cycle that we now know is supported by hCG during pregnancy. 
                  He identified some hormones that had a role in female reproduction, 
                  naming the hormone that promoted gestation, progesterone. Progesterone 
                  was isolated (an important step in the study of hormones) in 
                  1934. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1920s</b><br>
                  Independently, scientists in several laboratories across Europe 
                  described the presence of a substance that promotes ovary development 
                  and growth in rabbits and mice. In Germany, Selmar Aschheim 
                  and Bernhard Zondek noted that this substance specifically affected 
                  the formation of the corpus luteum. <br>
                  <br>
                  Scientists recognized that there is a specific hormone (now 
                  known as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)) that is only found 
                  in pregnant women. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1927 </b><br>
                  Aschheim and Zondek described a test (known as the A-Z test) 
                  which identified the presence of hCG in urine. To test for pregnancy, 
                  a woman&#8217;s urine was injected into an immature rat or mouse. 
                  If the subject was not pregnant, there would be no reaction. 
                  In the case of pregnancy, the rat would show an estrous reaction 
                  (be in heat) despite its immaturity. This test implied that 
                  during pregnancy there was an increased production of the hormone. 
                  During early studies of the A-Z test, the scientists discovered 
                  that testicular tumors could produce hCG as well.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1930s</b><br>
                  Hormone research blossomed in this period. Scientists in several 
                  different laboratories developed bioassays (special tests using 
                  animals or live tissue) to identify hCG by injecting samples 
                  to induce ovulation in rabbits, frogs, toads, and rats. These 
                  tests were expensive, required the sacrifice of several animals, 
                  and slow, often taking days to get results. The tests were also 
                  insensitive when measuring hormone levels to diagnose pregnancy 
                  because of the similarity between hCG and another substance, 
                  luteinizing hormone (LH). Most bioassays were in fact unable 
                  to distinguish between the two except at extraordinarily high 
                  rates of hCG. <br>
                  <br>
                  Herbert Evans discovered that when injected with certain fluids 
                  from the female glands a female rat would grow an abnormally 
                  large corpus luteum. These fluids were hormones now known as 
                  gonadotropins.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the next few decades laboratory scientists increased their 
                  level of interest in the study of human reproduction and on 
                  the role of ovaries and testes in human development.<br>

                  Hormones was held in London, marking the culmination of a decade

                  A &#8220;hemagglutination inhibition test&#8221; for pregnancy 
                  was developed by L. Wide and C.A. Gemzell. Because it used cells 
                  in the testing process, this test was an immunoassay rather 
                  than a bioassay. The test used purified hCG, mixed with a urine 
                  sample and antibodies directed against hCG. In a positive pregnancy 
                  test, the red cells clumped, displaying a particular pattern. 
                  This test was much faster and cheaper than the old bioassay, 
                  but still relatively insensitive, especially for early diagnosis 
                  of pregnancy. The test also cross-reacted with various medications.

                  Scientists at NIH learned more about the properties of hCG. 
                  They were specifically interested in which parts of the hormone 
                  showed biologic activity. Using various methods, they identified 
                  two subunits of hCG and focused on the beta-subunit. They found 
                  that the beta-subunit is where the immunologic and biologic 
                  specificity of hCG resides (what makes it different from other 
                  hormones). Using animal models, they took advantage of this 
                  discovery to develop a specific antiserum for measuring the 
                  hormone in humans.<br>

                  In a 1972 textbook on gonadotropins, Vaitukaitis and Ross noted

                  among hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH have made the production of specific

                  team was close: &#8220;the recent isolation and separation of 
                  subunits&#8230;have provided unique materials with which these 
                  questions could be explored.&#8221;<br>
