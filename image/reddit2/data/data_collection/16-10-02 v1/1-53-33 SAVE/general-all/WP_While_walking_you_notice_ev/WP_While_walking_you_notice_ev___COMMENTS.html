I never asked her out loud of course, I didn’t want to mess it up. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. </p>

<p>We had lunch by ourselves and she told me of her life. It was an ironic thing, but she was quite active. She lived in a home by the lake. An endless lake with dark waters that moved to show the million faces of the currently dying. It was always winter there, or autumn. She said she never could tell. When she was out, and she was out often, she was always caught up in some drama, some excitement. </p>

<p>“I always come at the end of a story,” she told me.</p>

<p>I laughed because I wanted her to like me. At first I thought she was insane. She called herself Death, and she meant it. Eventually, she proved it to me. And proved it, she did.</p>

<p>No one spoke to her, they all recoiled. I wondered why; I mean she was so beautiful. Was it intimidation? I didn’t know until she took me to her house. It was the home by the lake. It had taken me quite some time to make conversation with her and I was reeling in disbelief. From small talk to her home, I had made it with such a wonderful girl.</p>

<p>She told me to sit out on the porch and we ate mangoes. She liked them, was all she said. The lake was beautiful and it was cold out and the million voices floated in a winter’s chill.</p>

<p>“So what do you do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t you know if you’re Death?” I asked. I was trying to play hard to get.</p>

<p>“I don’t concern myself with living.”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t do anything.” I didn’t mean to say it how I did.</p>

<p>She looked out to her lake and told me to come. I followed her to the edge and stared at a face, swirling in misery. There was no jumping in the water. I stared into the face’s cold eyes, feeling its pain, making a connection. Then we were there.</p>

<p>The boy had fallen from a tree. It was hot wherever we were. He stared at me, pleading as if I could help. He refused to look at her. He opened his mouth but the life had evaporated. His body was dead, his consciousness dying. She lifted him as if he were a baby, cradled him, and he cried like one. I wondered how no one heard, but no one seemed to care. </p>

<p>“I guess that’s that,” she told him.</p>

<p>There was the sound of snapping, sharp thunder almost. She rested him back as we had found him.</p>

<p>“They don’t like that,” she said. “He had so much life remaining. They don’t like me taking it away. I don’t like it either.”</p>

<p>I felt sick. Before I could talk we had come back to her house and were standing beside the lake. </p>

<p>“What happens now?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There’s room for another face to rise.”</p>

<p>We finished our lunch, but I hardly ate. Death looked to be in pain and she stared out into the cold. I knew I would have to leave soon. I didn’t know what to say. She was still beautiful. Finally I asked her:</p>

<p>“Why did you bring me here?”</p>

<p>“Well, you looked desperate. You looked lonely. You looked like you needed someone to talk to. Someone to let you know that you exist. I guess I just felt sorry for you. I didn’t want you to end up killing yourself.”</p>

Thank you to everyone who gave me advice and read the original. It means a lot. I hope this version is just as good.</h4>

<p>She didn’t like to talk to me, I could tell, and I wondered why she did it. I never asked her out loud of course, I didn’t want to mess it up. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. </p>

<p>We had lunch by ourselves and she told me of her life. It was an ironic thing, but she was quite active. She lived in a home by the lake. An endless lake with dark waters that moved to show the million faces of the currently dying. It was always winter there, or autumn. She said she never could tell. When she was out, and she was out often, she was always caught up in some drama, some excitement. </p>

<p>“I always come at the end of a story,” she told me.</p>

<p>I laughed because I wanted her to like me. At first I thought she was insane. She called herself Death, and she meant it. Eventually, she proved it to me. And proved it, she did.</p>

<p>No one spoke to her, they all recoiled. I wondered why; I mean she was so beautiful. Was it intimidation? I couldn’t tell. I just knew I wanted to be with her. I wanted her to acknowledge me. For the first time in a long time it felt like there was a relief from the black storm that had been raging in my head. But I still didn’t know why everyone avoided her. I didn’t know until she took me to her house. It was the home by the lake. It had taken me quite some time to make conversation with her and I was reeling in disbelief. From small talk to her home, I had made it with such a wonderful girl.
 She told me to sit out on the porch and we ate mangoes. She liked them, was all she said. The lake was beautiful and it was cold out and the million voices floated in a winter’s chill.</p>

<p>“So what do you do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t you know if you’re Death?” I asked. I was trying to play hard to get.</p>

<p>“I don’t concern myself with living.”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t do anything.” I didn’t mean to say it how I did. </p>

<p>“You’re doing something right now, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“And soon I’d be doing something worse.”</p>

<p>She looked out to her lake and told me to follow. I felt as if I had ruined my chances and I hated myself. I followed her to the edge of the lake and my thoughts were swept up and my mind was blank. I stared at a face, swirling in misery. There was no jumping in the water. I stared into the face’s cold eyes, feeling its pain, making a connection. Then we were there.</p>

<p>The boy had fallen from a tree. It was hot wherever we were. He stared at me, pleading as if I could help. He refused to look at her. He opened his mouth but the life had evaporated. His body was dead, his consciousness dying. She lifted him as if he were a baby, cradled him, and he cried like one. I wondered how no one heard, but no one seemed to care. </p>

<p>“I guess that’s that,” she told him.</p>

<p>There was the sound of snapping, sharp thunder almost. She rest him back as we had found him.</p>

<p>“They don’t like that,” she said. “He had so much life remaining. They don’t like me taking it away. I don’t like it either.”</p>

<p>I felt sick. Before I could talk we had come back to her house and were standing beside the lake. </p>

<p>“What happens now?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There’s room for another face to rise.”</p>

<p>We finished our lunch, but I hardly ate. Death looked to be in pain and she stared out into the cold. I knew I would have to leave soon. I didn’t know what to say. She was still beautiful. Finally I asked her:</p>

<p>“Why did you bring me here?”</p>

<p>“Well, you looked desperate. You looked lonely. You looked like you needed someone to talk to. Someone to let you know that you exist. I guess I just felt sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Why would you feel sorry for me?”</p>

<p>“You just looked like you needed someone.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you didn’t concern yourself with the living?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. You weren’t living. You were like that boy, dead before you knew it. I can’t say why I did it. To be honest, I guess I just didn’t want you to end up killing yourself.”</p>

<p>I also posted the same chapter from the novel on the Sunday Free Write Thread on this sub, so you can read it there also :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll really consider creating a sub soon though! I never expected anyone to really like my writing.</p>

A beauty so vibrant I swear the world around her looked to come alive just a <em>little</em> bit more.</p>

<p>And yet, it seemed that no one agreed. Quite the opposite, judging by the ushering of children from her sight.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think back to that day, when I saw her. It brings a certain warmth to my heart when it starts to ice over. I was only eight at the time, but I&#39;ll never forget her.</p>

<p>&quot;Why is everyone scared of you?&quot; I asked, tugging at her skirt. &quot;You&#39;re so pretty.&quot;</p>

<p>It was her who then looked oddly at me. &quot;You think so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do. You&#39;re like a movie star!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve dabbled in Hollywood,&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;Then again, that&#39;s not saying much. You want to know why they hate me?&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded with the fervor of a curious child.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone sees me differently. Usually, people are scared. They hate me because I remind them of what is inevitable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know what death is?&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded again, slower this time.</p>

<p>&quot;What comes to mind when you think of it?&quot; </p>

<p>I thought hard, staring into the concrete. &quot;Well, I know that when Mr. Pebbles went away, my Mommy used that word. It&#39;s when things go away for a long time, right?&quot;</p>

<p>The woman smiled at me. &quot;Yes, a very long time at that. They don&#39;t ever come back here. Doesn&#39;t that frighten you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm. No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think it&#39;d be really boring if we were here forever. Besides, Mr. Pebbles hurt a lot. Wherever he went, things hurt less for him.&quot;</p>

<p>She got down on one knee and touched my face, much to the horror of everyone around us. &quot;You&#39;re a sweet child, but there&#39;s much you&#39;ve yet to learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet there&#39;s all kinds of stuff, yeah. But wherever we all go at the end, I bet it&#39;s something really cool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot; She opened her mouth to speak, but closed it and stood up. &quot;I&#39;ll let you find it all out for yourself. Well meet again, someday. You might not be happy to see me.&quot;</p>

<p>It was my turn to smile at her. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly. I can&#39;t wait to see you! Maybe we&#39;ll see each other wherever Mr. Pebbles went.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, I think we will.&quot; And in just a mere moment, it was like she had never been there. To this day, I wonder if I&#39;ll still see her the same way. I worry I might not.</p>

<p>But I remember her smile, and all doubt disappears like she did on that sunny summer day.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, that lady&#39;s so pretty even the girls are scared to get caught looking t her.&quot; I thought to myself as I walked towards home. A few canned ravioli and a box of crackers bounced together with each step I took.</p>

<p>The lady walked in a subtle glide. Each step masked by her long dress. It was so smooth you could never determine when either foot would fall. Her hands didn&#39;t even give away movement, they were clasped in front of her holding a small handbag. Her cool white skin seemingly made of milky water was pure marble without the gray colors. Her raven hair lay in shiny straight lines beside her face. </p>

<p>I drew her attention as I stared at her, regretting it almost immediately. I never intended to embarrass her. I never really got stared at, I assume &quot;embarrassed&quot; was how you felt when you caught someone watching you. I sucked in a deep, sharp breath, bit my bottom lip, and proceeded to do something I&#39;d never done before. I went to go talk to a pretty lady.</p>

<p>&quot;I, I think, I think I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I mumbled in my assassination of English as a language.</p>

<p>&quot;You... think?&quot; She said with a coy smile pulling up the right corner of her lip.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, what I mean is I <em>am</em> sorry. I just don&#39;t know if I should be or not.&quot; I flubbed further. Why couldn&#39;t my mouth, word, or my mind, brain?</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s try this.&quot; She said raising the other side of her lip with the other. &quot;Why do you <em>think</em> you should be sorry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was looking at you and you&#39;re pretty. So, I am sure you&#39;re probably tired of being stared at by people like me who think you&#39;re pretty. I didn&#39;t want to think you were pretty and stare at you because you were pretty but you are pretty... and, and I&#39;m making things worse now.&quot; I managed to say in a single unbroken breath. &quot;Could you just, ya know, go ahead and kill me.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes shot open wide and focused on mine for a brief second after that last sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you do know? You do know who I am?&quot; All color and cheer now gone from her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I may? I don&#39;t think I recognize you, did we go to school together? If so, I am really sorry, I&#39;ve kinda lost touch with everyone and forget names and faces really easily.&quot; At least the words were coherent and made some kind of a sense.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you don&#39;t know me then?&quot; She said with a look of complete befuddlement on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess, well I guess not. Are you famous? I am even worse with actor&#39;s names and faces than I am with real people. I&#39;ve watched entire movies before trying to remember where I&#39;d seen the lead actor before, only to realize on the way out that it&#39;s a sequel.&quot; If you&#39;re going to fail, fail big they say. It&#39;s always best to imply that not only are you disrespectful and incompetent but also very, very stupid.</p>

<p>&quot;I am famous, in a sense...&quot; She said as her smile returned.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re not like the U.S. president or something are you? Because I might not ever live that embarrassment down.&quot; I said returning her smile.</p>

<p>She actually laughed. Like a light bark. It was almost as if it were an action she&#39;d completely forgotten she could take.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyways, I really am sorry for staring at you. I just had never seen a lady as lovely as you and thought that if I missed the chance to look at you for as long as I could, that I might regret it. I don&#39;t spend a lot of time regretting things but that feels like one thing I might have to make an exception for.&quot; Imply you&#39;re a stalker! Wonderful idea! I regained my footing, it felt like, only to fall directly onto my ass.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not mind. I don&#39;t think many people even glance at me, let alone stare. To find one of you who sees me so, it is quite endearing.&quot; She spoke as if from a time long since forgotten. In an unfamiliar accent.</p>

<p>&quot;I never do this. I promise I never do but, would you, would you want to maybe grab lunch?&quot; I managed to squeeze out before the nerve left me.</p>

<p>She stood completely still. Not that she&#39;d moved much before but her motions were now imperceptible. The width of her eyes did not inspire much hope, yet before she spoke again she smiled an almost goofy toothy grin.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never been asked, as such. It would be agreeable to me.&quot; She said, letting the corners of her eyes scrunch into the smile. &quot;Would now be acceptable?&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled in a much larger manner than she had. &quot;Of course. Now is perfect.&quot;</p>

<p>to be continued.</p>

<p>The guy sitting at the front desk gives me the OK and I march through the automatic doors with as much gusto as I can conjure, taking a deep breath, letting the crisp air fill my lungs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a couple steps to get to the fountain. They stopped running it a few days ago since fall is just around the corner, but it&#39;s still a nice place to sit.</p>

<p>Today, I get about halfway there and feel like my legs are going to give out. But I press on, wheezing and stumbling, because someone else is sitting on the marble ledge of the fountain.</p>

<p>She&#39;s facing away from me, and it looks like her hair is laced with cherry blossom petals. Upon closer examination, the chick&#39;s goddamn hair is <em>made</em> of cherry blossom petals. You see something like that, you have to know what&#39;s up.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi. I&#39;m Marty,&quot; I say, extending a hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Death. Nice to meet you,&quot; she replies, offering a gentle handshake.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow. You must really be going through a phase, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you go around and say a thing like that? &#39;Hi, I&#39;m Death.&#39; That&#39;s not gonna be a great way to make friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me about it. You&#39;re the first person in weeks who&#39;s actually approached me.&quot; She runs a hand through the cherry blossoms and glances nervously at the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s a shame. I think more people oughta talk to each other. Makes the whole thing easier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm-hmm.&quot; She sighs and looks me in the eye. &quot;You must be pretty close, then.&quot;</p>

<p>I raise an eyebrow. &quot;Wha--what are you--?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one comes to talk to me unless they&#39;re close, Martin.&quot;</p>

<p>I take a deep breath, let the early-autumn air fill my lungs, and exhale slowly. &quot;So you&#39;re not kidding around, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>I glance back at the automatic doors. Nurse Robson taps her watch.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not ready,&quot; I say.</p>

<p>&quot;No one ever is. But let me tell you something.&quot; She takes a clump of petals from her hair and places them in my palm. &quot;I can tell, by the look in your eyes, that you&#39;re not repulsed by me. You&#39;re not afraid. A little upset, maybe, but not truly afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>I clutch the petals tightly. &quot;I&#39;m scared about what I&#39;m leaving behind. The people, the places.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But at the same time, you long for an existence without pain.&quot;</p>

<p>A tear falls from my cheek and lands on my legs, near-useless and failing like the rest of my body. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Martin, prolonging the inevitable only leads to more struggle. I know your body is still fighting, but you&#39;ll know when it&#39;s time.&quot;</p>

<p>I look back at the nurse, who is attaching a new bag of IV medication to my walking-support pole, then stare at the girl. </p>

<p>She pats my hand. &quot;I&#39;ll be here by the fountain, waiting for you.&quot;</p>

<p>I walk back through the doors, open my palm, and notice that the cherry blossom is gone. Death, however, is still at the fountain, staring off into the distance.</p>

<p>Everything hurts. Everything is crying out for help, unable to subsist on the chemicals they keep pumping in me. Somehow, when I woke up this morning, I knew this was the day.</p>

<p>But now I&#39;m ready to say goodbye.</p>

<p>&quot;So what?&quot; She questioned, tilting her head curiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Beautiful. You are incredibly beautiful.&quot; I was astonished that I was able to speak as she had taken by breath away.</p>

<p>She giggled. &quot;Beautiful? I can&#39;t say I get called that very often. Many people see me differently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do people usually see you as?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rotting, decaying, diseased...you know, death-related things. You should be alarmed, honestly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alarmed?&quot; I paused. &quot;Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, people only really see me as &#39;beautiful&#39; if...if they&#39;re, longing for me. You know. Suicidal.&quot; She sounded strangely sad, but I could only smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m far from suicidal. I&#39;m loving every minute of living, honest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are? Then it&#39;s curious as to why you see me this way, human.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh it&#39;s not really all that curious, I&#39;m just a necrophiliac is all.&quot;</p>

<p>Not once in Meredith&#39;s life had she seen someone quite that staggering. Surrounded by droves of writhing onlookers, the beautiful woman wearing a sundress and sandals strode on through the crowd, wearing a rather displeased expression. Such things weren&#39;t uncommon in her life- ones who could bend the will of entire cities, or cause everyone that saw them to shiver in fear or awe. </p>

<p>But why, then, was Meredith unaffected?</p>

<p>Meredith blinked and stepped aside as a man ran past her, babbling inanely. Others around her were experiencing much the same. One man urinated uncontrollably whilst shouting about his mother. Another begged for his life, making reference to some being known as &#39;God&#39;. In short, the beautiful black-haired woman&#39;s presence was throwing the entire street into disarray.</p>

<p>&quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, I&#39;m in a bit of a hurry.&quot; </p>

<p>Meredith&#39;s observations of the crowd were interrupted as the woman stepped closer to her, stopping just nearby. Eyes of emerald, silky hair, and fair skin greeted her vision. For a moment- and only a moment- it seemed as though time had stopped. It clearly hadn&#39;t, however, as the woman frowned and crossed her arms, as a man cowered next to her foot. </p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re not going to make me walk around you with a crowd like this here, are you?&quot; she continued to ask. Her voice was reminiscent of an angels&#39; choir, sonorous and mature. &quot;Because that would be inconvenient.&quot;</p>

<p>Meredith blinked dryly, again, and averted her eyes. &quot;Sorry. I was trying to blend in, but I guess I did a bad job of it.&quot; Her voice was low and nearly inaudible over the din of the crowd, though many of the frightened civilians were starting to make their way out of the immediate area. </p>

<p>The woman&#39;s eyebrow simply raised, in response to Meredith&#39;s answer. &quot;Blend in?&quot; she asked, &quot;You&#39;d have to... scream and fall over, if you wanted to blend in.&quot; Her arms uncrossed as she stepped aside, trying to look up and into Meredith&#39;s eyes. &quot;But you are doing neither.&quot;</p>

<p>Meredith shrugged her shoulders, as if trying to remain casual about the whole thing. In truth, she was sweating- but fortunately for her, it was not apparent on her face yet. Again, her eyes averted, and she made her lips form into a tight line. &quot;Guess not. What&#39;s everyone so afraid of, anyway?&quot; she asked. It seemed to be a question posed to herself, as she answered herself soon after, &quot;It&#39;s just a cute girl.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman&#39;s head turned, tilted, and then tilted back again. &quot;A cute girl?&quot; she asked. She stepped around Meredith again, trying once more to look into her eyes. &quot;I am not a grizzly old bear, in your eyes? Or a pile of mocking, laughing, decapitated heads? A wrathful wife, bearing a bloodied knife?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. You&#39;re just a cute girl,&quot; Meredith answered, quite simply. &quot;Green eyes are kind of rare. Only ever see them on television.&quot; </p>

<p>The woman stared blankly at Meredith for a few moments, before offering a dry laugh. &quot;Well, this is a surprise,&quot; she said, shaking her head a bit. &quot;You can see my true self.&quot; She smiled in an oddly alluring way, and then stepped astride Meredith. She grabbed the woman&#39;s arm, and began marching away down the street with her, the way she had been previously heading. &quot;A refreshing change from the usual affair. You&#39;ll come with me for a time, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>Meredith stumbled at first, but kept pace with her soon after. &quot;I... uh...&quot; she muttered, blushing a fiery red. &quot;I don&#39;t know- it&#39;s late, and all-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is shortly after <em>noon</em>, dear,&quot; the woman interruped. &quot;I assure you, I will do nothing untoward. It is a rarity to find one such as yourself, that is all. I greatly enjoy the company of those who can appreciate my true visage.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I mean- you really <em>are</em> pretty,&quot; Meredith said, rather awkwardly. &quot;But I don&#39;t know your name, or anything.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nor do I yours,&quot; the shorter woman said. She kept a deceitfully strong grip on Meredith&#39;s arm, and it was clear that she would not let go, short of Meredith chewing off her own extremity. &quot;But if we are to skip courtesies, my name is Tealechiariel. Many who know me merely call me &#39;Teale&#39;, however. You may, as well.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well- alright, uh... Teale.&quot; Meredith carefully tried to pull her arm away. After coming to realize that Teale was much stronger than she, the woman said, &quot;My name&#39;s Meredith. I live nearby... kind of. A few blocks away. I was going out for milk, and then I saw the street shitting itself. I mean- the people, on the street.&quot;</p>

<p>Teale chuckled quietly, holding onto Meredith&#39;s arm in a way that was deliberately couple-like. One hand reached down to lock in with Meredith&#39;s hand, and Teale&#39;s other rested on Meredith&#39;s elbow, daintily. &quot;Only a few blocks, you say?&quot; she asked, &quot;Interesting. I am currently staying with a friend, for what I am sure will be a number of months. The forces that be willed it, and so it will be.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The forces that be...?&quot; Meredith mumbled to herself. &quot;What are you? Sorry. That&#39;s kind of rude- but I feel like I should know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am a manifestation of the end,&quot; Teale said. &quot;When onlookers gaze upon me, they see their greatest fears, in their wildest depictions. Some see naught but fire and ash, while others see crazed loved ones. It is... distressing, at times. I very nearly feel bad, for them.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why do I see <em>you</em>, then?&quot; Meredith asked. With her free hand, she rubbed at her eyes. They were a bluish-brown, which was rather common, where she was from. Beneath them rested heavy, dark circles- not made with makeup, but rather, a lack of sleep. &quot;My greatest fear isn&#39;t to hold hands with a cute girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To say that it is base fears is a misnomer, perhaps. It is their perception of the concept of death,&quot; Teale responded. &quot;Many fear the end. Some embrace it, with open arms. Some are too stubborn to believe they will meet their end.&quot; She turned her head up toward Meredith, smirking wryly. &quot;Until they meet me, that is. A man once claimed to see me as a volcano- can you believe that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. Sounds pretty crazy,&quot; Meredith said. &quot;A whole volcano? Weird.&quot; She stared ahead, her expression blank. &quot;I guess I don&#39;t know how I feel about death. It&#39;s just a part of things. A big part, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, it is,&quot; Teale rather happily replied, nodding her head. &quot;You are quite open minded, I see. That is good.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess. I didn&#39;t really want to crap myself today, and if you&#39;d been my biggest fear, I probably would have,&quot; Meredith said. She continued to walk along with Teale for a short time, before asking, &quot;By the way, just where are we going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have some business to take care of- nothing too important- and then I had planned on spending the rest of the afternoon seeing the city,&quot; Teale said, &quot;But now that I have met a peculiar and cute girl who can see my true nature for what it is, I am unsure what I will do afterward. Do you have any interest in spending the day at my side, Meredith?&quot; She looked up toward the taller woman&#39;s face, batting her eyelashes. </p>

<p>Meredith once again turned her head away, turning red in the face. While her plans for the rest of the evening had likely involved pizza, a can of carbonated swill, and many hours of insomnia, she could just as easily shift those plans ahead a few days. Just as well, being called &#39;peculiar and cute&#39; brought up a strange feeling in her chest, one she hadn&#39;t felt since at least her later years in highschool. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>That was the best Meredith could offer, and Teale smiled and hugged her arm just a bit tighter. &quot;Wonderful. Let us be on our way, then,&quot; she said, though she quickly added, &quot;Ah! There is a shop over there that sells hats, Meredith! I want to try some on!&quot; Before Meredith could react, she was already being pulled across a busy street full of shrieking onlookers and braking cars. </p>

<p>&quot;W-Wait a minute, Teale! What about your business?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It can wait! I <em>must</em> have a hat with a wide brim! It would make my outfit just perfect!&quot;</p>

<p>And so, Meredith was dragged by the arm through a store that sold hats. They were not asked to pay, as the cashier working the register at the store&#39;s front only saw a six-legged horror from the depths wearing a sunhat, and could not comprehend Teale&#39;s true form. Meredith was dragged to numerous other stores, where Teale helped herself to various accessories, before she was finally dragged off to see whatever Teale&#39;s &#39;business&#39; happened to be.</p>

<p>But, at the very least, she wasn&#39;t exactly unhappy. Just very, very confused and stunned by the day&#39;s events.</p>

<p>Curious, I kept watching and saw as their faces would twist with horror and revulsion, before moving aside to let her pass or going to the other side of the street altogether. Witnessing this happening a few more times, I got up from the bench were I was seated and assume drew closer, offering her a slight smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, um, I don&#39;t mean to be rude, or nosy- But is there a reason why everyone avoids you?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked startled as I spoke. Her eyebrows drew into a curiosity filled frown, before she replied &quot;Yes, yes there is. I am Death. Those who look upon me see my appearance based on how they feel about death. You... See me differently, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>I felt as though with her I would always be happy- That I would finally find peace. I nodded with some difficulty, and her expression grew sad.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not what you look for, despite what you may think.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have met many like you, over the years. Those who believe that they will find tranquility, and peace in me. They are wrong, you are wrong.&quot; She placed her hand rested gently on my cheek for a moment, eyes searching mine, and I shivered.</p>

<p>Even as we stood here people gave her a wide berth, their eyes barely glancing across her before dancing away quickly in fear. </p>

<p>&quot;Go.&quot; She said softly, taking her hand away. &quot;You are still young. Life isn&#39;t as cruel as you might believe. You have much to live for.&quot;</p>

<p>Turning away, she offered me a sad smile and a small wave over her shoulder, walking through the crowd and leaving me more than a little stunned, gaping at the spot she stood until she was long gone.</p>

<p>And later I would meet her, years later, still as entrancingly beautiful as the first time we met, and she would smile and take my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;You have lived a good life. You are ready.&quot;</p>

Come home via transport, play video games, make dinner. Go to sleep.</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat. </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t the smartest person in high school. He got his diploma, he got out of there, out of the <em>system</em> that he had always detested, watched as the honours students all went to university.</p>

<p>He worked every day. It was a nice job, relatively: it wasn&#39;t too horrid, not like retail had been when he was going to school, and it kept food on the table.</p>

<p>Eight hour work day. Bus home. Bit of Dota. Eat dinner. Sleep, wake up.</p>

<p>Again and again. He wasn’t even paying attention any more, he couldn’t remember what he had done yesterday, the weekends were a blur of drinking alone. Was the life of his old acquaintances like this? </p>

<p>No, he reminded himself. They had friends. They made friends.</p>

<p>He had friends, once, didn’t he? Back in school. Right. Wonder what happened to them.</p>

<p>Work. Bus. Game. Eat. Sleep? Get up.</p>

<p>He sat beside a woman on the bus. About his age, tall, beautiful. </p>

<p>“Hi.”</p>

<p>Good going. He’s not worth anything, he’s so awkward, intimidated by the idea of having human contact outside his workplace. What a failure. Waste of life.</p>

<p>She blushes and turns away, a little bit, then looks at him. “Hello.”</p>

<p>They talk, for a few minutes, before the bus stops. He gets her name - Libitina. She says it’s latin, her parents were rather into history. He doesn’t really care. She gives him her number, and gets off.</p>

<p>Work for a few hours. Take the bus home, but she isn’t there, that’s all right, she said she had a very time consuming job. He turns on the television. Shooting in a mall downtown. </p>

<p>He locks his door.</p>

<p>Dinner is good. It has a little more flavour, today, perhaps. But he doesn’t notice, and he goes to bed.</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>He sees her on the bus again, and he sits beside her. They talk a little - she’s into philosophy. Him? He’s into … well, not much. She recommends writing, he remembers he enjoyed it when he was in school. Makes a mental note to get some paper that his notes can be physical. </p>

<p>He works, and his boss tells him to go home early, you worked hard today.</p>

<p>She’s on the phone and they talk, him sitting in front of his computer, looking up writing guides. There was this story he always wanted to write, he remembers now, and it gnaws at him a little. He doesn’t stop smiling until he falls asleep.</p>

<p>They chat on the bus again and he’s a bit worried. She doesn’t look so great, today, a bit of an ashen look tinging her features. He’d ask, but knows not to pry. Perhaps she’s ill - but she was fine yesterday.</p>

<p>He gets a raise. His boss pats him on the back.</p>

<p>They talk into the night, and he’s never felt better.</p>

<p>He’s never had a girlfriend before, but he’s so lonely, maybe he’s found one? Maybe he’s found <em>the one</em>. It’s odd, but he’s never felt this eager waiting for the bus.</p>

<p>He doesn’t see her on the bus, today. He sits beside an elderly woman, and she smiles at him. He smiles back and they talk a little bit. She’s into philosophy.</p>

Sure our marriage isn’t a conventional one by any means, but hey, love is love. </p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking, marrying literal death seems like an ill-advised idea. I assure you though, the truth is it’s the opposite. I think this might be the best god damn idea I’ve ever had.</p>

<p>First of all the sex is AMAZING. Seriously, the sex is so good I could die. I can change her to be whoever I’m feeling for. I want to fuck Jennifer Lawrence? Just got to think of her as the literal embodiment of our short, horrifying and often abrupt end to our existence on this world and BAM—I’m fucking her. The best part is the chick is just as kinky as I want her to be. Let’s just say death is into some pretty experimental shit. </p>

<p>Now of course dating the grim reaper has its perks other than the sex. If someone at my workplace annoys me, BAM, heart attack the next day. It’s perfect for dealing with racist, sexist, homophobic, and whatever other flavor of asshole that I could possibly encounter. Of course, this sort of power trip has messed me up in the head a little, and that’s saying something considering the previous paragraph had me bragging about fucking death.</p>

<p>Unfortunately though it’s not all sunshine and shiny scythes in relationships, especially this one. I fear for my life constantly when I get into an argument with the dumb broad. I swear, considering she’s supposed to be an immortal being thats hunted mortal souls since before any of my grand-grand-grand-whatever parents were even born, she’s super fucking needy. “Why don’t you pay attention to me” “does this black robe make my butt look big” “stop looking at those human women” yadayadayada, she’s so annoying. Well, perhaps I’m being too harsh. I still love my snookums after all.</p>

<p>Of course that was many many years ago. She’s been a little evasive with the subject of my mortality. She thinks that killing me would be super romantic. I mean, I can see where she’s coming from I guess. I just hope she doesn’t do that Sopranos shit and cut--</p>

<p>The famous Frankie Valli song played over and over in my head as I stood enchanted by this magnificent woman. I looked around to see if others had noticed her as well, and was shocked to see the reactions.</p>

<p>One man stopped in his tracks like a deer in the headlights, with a look of speechless terror in his eyes. Another woman took one glance and began to cry hysterically. And one old man looked at her and began to nod his head with a sad pitiful expression of submission. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t make sense, how could no one be acknowledging the beauty of this woman? Did she have some terrible body odour? An ugly voice? A terrible scar that I couldn&#39;t see from where I stood? I had to know, so I approached her slowly, and when I got to within 10 feet we locked eyes.</p>

<p>Her eyes were a gorgeous green colour that I had never seen before, and when I smiled, she revealed a smile more perfect than any other. Tongue tied, I let out a barely audible &quot;Hi&quot; and stood captivated for her response. She seemed almost caught off guard that someone actually wanted to converse, and responded with a pleasant &quot;Hello there Adam.&quot; This took me by surprise, how did she know my name?</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be alarmed Adam, I try to learn the names of all of Earth&#39;s souls, it&#39;s the least I could do for when we eventually meet.&quot; I raised an eyebrow and had a look of confusion on my face as I inspected her face for clues of sarcasm.</p>

<p>&quot;What I&#39;m trying to say is... I am death Adam, and every soul must eventually meet me. And as you can probably imagine, death is not a pretty sight for most people.&quot; </p>

<p>My eyebrow lowered, and along with it my jaw, as shock took the place of confusion. I let out a mumbled response, &quot;B-b-but... you look so beautiful...&quot; She smiled, seeming flattered by what I mumbled and explained, &quot;That&#39;s because you are not like most people Adam, you are a kind and pure man, living for a life beyond this one.&quot;</p>

<p>I was flattered to hear this, but a little taken aback, was I about to die? I did not fear death, but I was not yet ready to die. </p>

<p>She seemed to sense my unease, and quickly clarified, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it is not yet your time. But when you do see me again, make sure to smile...&quot;</p>

Why would anyone walk away from you?&quot; I questioned the beautiful woman as she looked deeply into my eyes as if she felt even the slightest amount of attraction toward me like I did her. </p>

<p>&quot;Everyone sees what they feel. I cant help what they see.&quot; The statement perplexed me. What they wanted? What else could they see, and if it was so different from mine then what did it look like to them?</p>

<p>&quot;You truly are beautiful.... I am at a loss for words. I wish I could explain it but my breath just seems to disappear. I am sorry. Please believe me.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help myself. I was entranced. I&#39;ve never felt such a strong attraction to anyone in my entire twenty one years on this earth. </p>

<p>&quot;That is an amazing feeling every time I hear it. So welcoming. So.... ready. It&#39;s beautiful in itself. I hear it every so often, but it never gets old.&quot; The woman stroked my cheek, and my desire grew stronger as I felt my body shiver and grow weak. </p>

<p>&quot;I want to spend forever with you. Please, just give me your name and I will treat you better than you&#39;ve ever been treated!&quot; It was such a strange rush of emotions. I stood atop the freeway just 10 minutes ago ready to jump. I was so ready to welcome my death and be gone from this disgusting world, but I finally found something, someone worth spending time here. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you will spend forever with me. You are exactly what I was looking for.&quot; She slowly closed her eyes and leaned in, kissing me. I remember nothing else before waking up to this. It&#39;s dark, and cold here. It looks like my room, but grey and silent. I miss her.</p>

The cold grey fog had swept into the corridors turning the lights into hazy yellow clouds. It was perfect, after weeks of scouting the stations on the J line I had found a time when the trains still ran, but had minimal people. As I come up to the end of the platform I glance down. The distance to the rail seemed much higher than I had remembered. Not that it would matter soon. I check the sign. 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The wait is agony. I pace back and forth scuffing my shoes against the yellow raised dots marking the drop into the train rails. The recessed dark metal and stone that would likely be very close, very soon. Maybe if I were blind I could have just pretended I didn&#39;t notice these and-</p>

<p>Tak. Tak.</p>

<p>Someones here? I quickly turn toward the sound. A pale woman with pitch black hair and heels walks emerges from the fog. Her chiffon mermaid dress bounces as each stiletto marches closer towards me. The scarlet of her lips stand out against her lovely skin. The look on her face, all-knowing and poised. I&#39;ve never seen a more beautiful woman in my life. </p>

<p>We stand face to face, and I can&#39;t help but stare into her eyes. She&#39;s not saying anything,  nothing at all, but it&#39;s as if we had been speaking the entire time. The feeling of familiarity and safety draws me closer and closer. I stared, and stared my eyes drawn to every portion of her frame. She stares back with looks like confusion at first, then understanding. After what felt like an eternity she brings her hand to her face, and coyly drags a finger against those scarlet lips. I swallow.</p>

<p>A low rumble starts in the distance followed by a whistle. Its the train. I came all this way, all this time but I just couldn&#39;t turn away.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re... Beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman smiles, and walks towards me, crowding the space around me. My heart races, and I make no move to stop her. Now, close enough that I can feel the cold off of her skin, she makes a spinning motion with her hands. She must mean...</p>

<p>I turn around, and her hands brush up my back. The feeling of her fingers and palms tracing up my back makes me shudder. The train approaches swiftly, growing larger and closer by the second. For a moment I think she&#39;s holding onto me. Clinging onto my torso.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never met someone who looked at me the way you do. You&#39;ve made an old woman very happy.&quot; She whispers into my ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; I ask placing a hand on her wrist.</p>

<p>&quot;The one you&#39;ve been waiting for.&quot;</p>

<p>Before I can respond she withdraws her embrace and suddenly her hands are against my back. With a gentle nudge, I&#39;m pushed off the edge.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Welp looks like I missed the first part of the prompt. And here I thought I was already fudging it.</p>

This would be the last year of my life. After three decades of what was once living and lately has been breathing, eating, and sleeping, I&#39;ve decided to let go. Throughout my twenties I spent the long days and sleepless nights alone thinking of whether or not I would ever find someone and whether or not I would find my way. My friends were where they wanted to be and with who they wanted to be with and they seemed happy at best and content at worst. I used to be one of them. Sure, it was long ago but still; I was one of the guys living life as best I could and that was good enough for me.</p>

<p>For the past decade, it hasn&#39;t been enough.</p>

<p>Watching people I went to high school and grew up with pass me by professionally, socially, and romantically got me way down in a hole that I could never seem to find my way out of. Down in that hole, I could hear the sounds of the world, see peaks of light above, and feel the warm and cold of the air throughout the seasons. </p>

<p>I could never get close enough to it all and it slowly ate me up inside. Life was going on up above while I was suffering in silence down below, on my own, in a place and in a way that no one truly knew or cared about. Every now and then, I would catch a glimpse of what it was that I desired so much during those days alone and without hope - without a way out of my existential abyss below. </p>

<p>The most beautiful girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. At least that&#39;s what I told myself every time I would cross paths for the briefest moment in time with girls in the real world and outside of the confines of my sad life and the black hole of sorrow that is internet message boards for the long lost and forgotten societal afterthoughts among us. </p>

<p>In those rare moments of fleeting life where I would walk among the living, like a ghost among humans, I would be lucky enough to spot a beautiful girl whom I would imagine spending the rest of my day, the rest of my night, or the rest of my life with. She never knew me and I never knew her but any sort of glance or look in my direction was enough to make leaving my tiny apartment worth it, if not for just one day.</p>

<p>Today was one of those days. Today would be the last day though I didn&#39;t know it at the time I left my place to walk among the living in the city square. I&#39;ve always liked these rainy Fall days where the air is crisp, the leaves are soaked and strewn about, and the rain sprinkles lightly and softly down upon our heads as we move about, each in our own way. </p>

<p>An overcast day like this in Fall for me was as good as any sunny day at the beach with my toes in the sand. It&#39;s who I am, really. Life for me hasn&#39;t been sunshine and rainbows in a long time. A cloudy day with the occasional spot of sunshine through a few clouds is me. That&#39;s the best I&#39;ve been able to hope for in these last years.</p>

<p>Walking along, everything seemed the same. Dull, apart, and hopeless. Couples walked hand-in-hand; mothers pushed their children along in strollers; old men sat across from one another pushing their wooden pieces from square to square on the board; and the pidgeons bouncing and bobbing about in the midst of it all, without any care but that of what they&#39;ll be having for lunch. However, things aren&#39;t always what they seem. Today wouldn&#39;t be just another day and another aimless walk through the crowd. </p>

<p>Not with her sitting there. </p>

<p>There was quite a commotion all of a sudden. Women clutched their mens&#39; arms tighter and were whisked away. Young children shrieked in terror as their mothers raced from her with their strollers rolling along at speed. Old men stared in horror and pidgeons left their bread crumbs behind and scattered into the misty and grey sky. As they parted ways with her, I was able to see what had everyone in such a fuss. Why, it was a woman. And not just any woman. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. More beautiful than any who I had seen before when I walked among the living as the ghost in the city square, invisible to them and to the world. This woman was the most beautiful I had seen because she was the first and only one to have seen me in the same way that I had saw her. </p>

<p>No woman or girl of any age or time had looked at me this way before. The feeling was indescribable. I never wanted to let it go or to let her go. Her eyes were the most inviting and her smile made me feel the happiness that I hadn&#39;t known in so many years but was desperate to feel again. I would do anything for that smile and for her. Anything to feel like this good after so much time alone and sad. </p>

<p>I walked towards her - all the while curious and confused - while I wondered what everyone had recoiled in terror and disgust for. A beautiful woman is someone that everyone wants to be around. Men, women, and children alike are like bees to honey in the presence of such a pretty face.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you here for so long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For me? Do I know you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve known each other our whole lives. Don&#39;t you recognize me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No? I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever met and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve never seen you before in my life. These people. Why were they surrounding you? What was all the commotion for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Well, you see, some people aren&#39;t ready for me. Most, I would say, go nearly their whole lives without ever wanting to see me. I scare them. I scare them because they&#39;re afraid of what they don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why would they be scared of you? You&#39;re just...just a...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just what? What am I to you?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um, you&#39;re...very pretty. Surely you get that a lot, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Well, not a lot, no. Most of the time, people can&#39;t bare to look me in the face and when they do, I send them scattering. I must say that I don&#39;t care much for causing a scene. I prefer to be more discrete in my dealings with those whom I take an interest in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dealings? Interest? What do you deal in? Who are you interested in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m interested in you and I deal in whatever it is that you want me to. Whatever it is that you are looking for, I have to offer you. It comes at a price, of course. Naturally, so much does these days. So what are you interested in? What is it that you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just wanted to walk around a bit in the square. I like to sometimes. I don&#39;t think much of it and I don&#39;t think that anyone here thinks much of me either when I stroll around a bit each week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like being alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alone? Well...I don&#39;t mind walking around here alone, if that&#39;s what you mean. Generally? Yeah, I suppose I get lonely from time to time. All of the other people here seem like they have someone or something to bide and spend time with. I do suppose that I&#39;ve always wanted someone to walk with. It all feels a bit hopeless lately, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We all feel alone sometimes. But with me, you don&#39;t have to feel that way. For some of us, life can be a sad and solitary state of affairs. Some of us are born to live, to laugh, and to love others and have them love us in return. Others are born to be alone. In death, we are never alone, for death is where we all feel at home like we did when we were at our best and happiest in life. There is nothing to fear in death for you. Others cannot see and appreciate its beauty until they are old and gray like the sky. People like you see its beauty. You see me as I am. A beautiful stranger who you would love to get to know. Someone to walk with - like a ghost - among the limbs and masses of the living. Not alone, but happy together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted someone to walk arm-in-arm with here. It feels so good to have someone like you see me for who I am and to want me. The other women and girls who walk here never seem to glance or look my way. Everyone looks for them and relishes their beauty yet the love and care is never returned. You look like they do but you&#39;re not like them. I don&#39;t know why the others can&#39;t see you the way that I do. If no one will walk with you and no one will walk with me, then I would like it if we could walk together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would like that, too. But like I said before, such companionship must come at a price. Not one of dollars or cents but of trust and commitment. You must walk with me here each day and never return home until I say to. Anything you may have planned for or wanted to come into your life tomorrow must be set aside for me and our time here. You must have faith in me and never waver from our commitment or else I may turn into an uneasy sight once before you, only to leave you alone to walk here forever on your own, just as you have for so many years among the living as a ghost. Take my hand and say goodbye to your lonely life and sorrows. With me, you&#39;ll never walk alone.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, I decided to say goodbye to the known and to walk hand-in-hand through the now quiet and empty square with the unknown. For me, the unknown had never looked so familiar in such a beautiful woman, the likes of which I had seen here so many times before. But this time, it all felt different. I wasn&#39;t afraid of what might lie ahead tomorrow. I was relieved to know that I would face it hand-in-hand with her. Each day we would spend our time together here and I like that very much. It&#39;s much preferred to the life I knew where I spent each day living out the same sad and lonely existence only to end it with nights alone in my bed. </p>

<p>Among the living, life was a walk alone with each day known.</p>

<p>With Death, saying goodbye to life was saying hello to a beautiful stranger, together at last. </p>

In the middle of Central Park at the crack of dawn, where normally I found more homeless than I found people I could at least bare to be with, was this veritable goddess of a woman, on a bench, and I felt like I was the only person aware of it. Everyone seemed to walk as far on the sidewalk from her as they could, averting their eyes, avoiding her like the plague. What did everyone else know that I didn&#39;t? This was <strong><em>New York</em></strong>, the big apple, and she was treated like a worm crawling out of it. I was supposed to be having breakfast with a few friends before heading to work, but mystery, intrigue, and some primal instinct to approach someone so stunning got the better of me.  I didn&#39;t even think to straighten my embarrassingly loose tie, I just walked up, sat down, placed my briefcase full of technical documents, and was locked in my own silence. I couldn&#39;t even think what to say. Here I was, in the lions den I&#39;d tossed myself into without even thinking of what I&#39;d do once I got down here.</p>

<p>&quot;You can relax, I don&#39;t bite.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh thank <strong><em>god</em></strong>, she talked first. I exhaled, turned to face her, and was immediately greeted by the most brilliant, pronounced and... dead eyes I&#39;ve ever seen. How, I don&#39;t know. Everything else was so <strong><em>stunning</em></strong>, she was no older than twenty four, had the body of what supermodels <em>dream</em> they could look like, but her eyes. They were the eyes of someone who&#39;d seen things far beyond what people should ever see. And I&#39;ve seen vietnam vets, strewn on the side of the walkways, withering in their own piss and begging for a few coins. But this woman, she held something behind those milky, grey eyes. Sadly, yet again, I had failed my societal training and had been staring into her eyes for a solid twenty seconds without saying a word.</p>

<p>&quot;So, big guy, what do you see.&quot; She asked me. What did I see? Oh man, here was my chance. After this cavalcade of awkwardness, somehow she&#39;d given <strong><em>me</em></strong> the green light.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I see, I see the most gorgeous woman I&#39;ve eve-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, <strong><em>no</em></strong>. I know what I look like to you. But you didn&#39;t spend the last few moments looking up and down. You,&quot; she gently touched my nose, &quot;were up here.&quot; She pointed towards her own eyes, before lightly resting the tips of her fingers on my cheek. They were surprisingly cold.</p>

<p>&quot;I, well. I didn&#39;t see pain, or happiness. I just saw a lot of <strong><em>everything</em></strong>. Like you&#39;ve been everywhere, and partaken in nothing. I can&#39;t really describe it.&quot;</p>

<p>She chuckled, and relaxed back a little bit, distancing herself from me. &quot;Interesting. So, can you guess-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why were your hands so cold?&quot; I touched my own cheek, and sure enough, where she&#39;d had her hands was significantly chillier. So it wasn&#39;t just a figment of my imagination.</p>

<p>She huffed, &quot;Rude, now. Can you guess what <strong><em>they</em></strong> see?&quot; She made a discreet motion towards the rest of the people in the park.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, exactly what I&#39;m seeing. What else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong><em>They</em></strong>, as most people do, see the ugliest woman they&#39;ve ever laid eyes on. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woah, <strong><em>woah</em></strong>, but how? Have you been anywhere with even a remotely reflective piece of anything recently? I mean, how could-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I can&#39;t really act surprised. I would call you dense, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;d be able to guess you were talking to death, in any case. To you, I&#39;m just some random person on a bench.&quot;</p>

<p>I opened my mouth, she touched my lips, and I quickly shut them again. Any complaints or disagreements I once had were quickly silenced by her frigid skin. Alright, lady, I believe you.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; she laughed a little bit, &quot;Why do you see me as such a beautiful woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I mean. I&#39;m not sure, really-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You, <strong><em>you</em></strong>.&quot; She interrupted, in a scolding tone. &quot;Stop lying, you think I can&#39;t tell when you&#39;re stumbling around? You know exactly why, so just tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you&#39;ll never catch me.&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped. Not slowed down, stopped. Everything about her just <em>froze</em>, as if she realized the train was coming and there was nothing she could do to get out of the way. &quot;What?&quot; She murmured.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;l never catch me, that&#39;s why you&#39;re so beautiful. I mean, no wonder all those people would see you as ugly, they&#39;re <em>scared</em> of you. Because they see you at the end of the road. But I <em>don&#39;t.</em>&quot; I shifted forward, letting out some steam I&#39;d been keeping pent up ever since I devoted myself to the cause. &quot;I&#39;ll spend my <em>whole life</em>, not running from you, but <em>outsmarting</em> you. You&#39;ve had everyone since the beginning of time, but you&#39;ll never have <em>me</em>. I&#39;ll be your &#39;one that got away&#39;. And you want to know why? Because I&#39;ll spend the rest of my life making sure I fight you.&quot; I pushed the tip of my finger into her chest, and she froze yet again.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve spent the last twenty years working towards leaving this mortal coil, into a <em>machine</em>, and I have no intentions of stopping now. I&#39;ll be my own salvation, not you. While everyone else is fine with their own organic bodies, I&#39;ll find a way beyond it. I&#39;ll <em>evolve</em>. It&#39;s why everyone finds you so horrendous, because you&#39;re in control of them. But me? I&#39;m in control of <em>you</em>. So if you ever want to even get <em>close</em> to getting your hands on me, you better hurry. Because time&#39;s not running out for me, and it never will be.&quot; I stood up, tightened my tie, and walked away. The last look on her face was that of terror, like a person who&#39;d never lost anything had watched something he should have had slip away. A few yards down the sidewalk, I checked over my shoulder, and saw an empty bench. I smiled, and continued on my way to breakfast with my coworkers, to start another day.</p>

<p>I know how I see death. But I wonder how death now sees me.</p>

There he was leaning on the wall in the streets, just admiring what&#39;s around him. He notices someone switch the way he&#39;s walking right in front of him and lets out an audible laugh.</p>

<p>I walk up to him a bit shaky, as I notice everyone around him is filled with disgust. &quot;Hey!&quot; I said to get his attention, he looks a bit surprised and replies with a simple &quot;Hello!&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty confused?&quot; He says.</p>

<p>&quot;Very&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asks, while a look of surprise appears on his face gradually.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s just the fact that everyone around you... I don&#39;t know, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hates me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean... Ya, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised you mustered up the courage to talk to someone as frightening as myself.&quot; He laughs with a smirk.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I&#39;m almost confused as a hawk learning how to swim.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean, &#39;what&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re only one of the most attractive people I&#39;ve seen my whole life!&quot; I notice what I said, and can solidly say I have never felt this awkward in my life.</p>

<p>His eyes widen, his expression changes to that of pity, and he pats me on the shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;What terrible life have you lead?&quot; As he looks on, seemingly increasing his pity towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;W-What do you mean?&quot; I say, it&#39;s like he knows about it.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, everyone looks at me... differently&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t really follow?&quot; I&#39;m beginning to question what I got myself into.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone looks at me how they perceive death. I know this is a bit sudden, but please follow. Usually that means a hideous being. Yet you, you see me as one of the most handsome being in this world?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is this a joke?!&quot; I reply with a bit of anger here, and a bunch of sadness there.</p>

<p>It was at this very moment, I understood what people meant by the sweet embrace of death.</p>

<p>Yet everybody that walked past, seemed to take two steps away from her. </p>

<p>The girl noticed the person in front of me halt, turn around, and run back the way they came. &quot;Very discreet. . .&quot; she muttered to herself.</p>

<p>I caught the runner&#39;s eye&#39;s as they darted past it was a look of pure horror. </p>

<p>&quot;What was that about?&quot; I asked the girl. </p>

<p>She was taken aback by my abruptness. &quot;I&#39;m Death, everybody knows that. That&#39;s why they&#39;re all running away.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Death?&quot; I said,&quot;Your parents actually named you that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I&#39;m the real thing. The Reaper, thief of time, Grim as you formally label me.&quot; She picked up a flower and let it wilt between her fingers to prove her point. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Was all I could manage. </p>

<p>Death sighed and then continued down the walkway. </p>

<p>When she was a few steps over, I gathered my wits. &quot;Hey, wait up. I&#39;d like to find out more about this whole death thing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You aren&#39;t afraid?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nope.&quot; </p>

<p>And with that, we found ourselves at the nearest Mcafe with a coffee to keep warm between our hands. </p>

<p>The people at the table next to us picked up their stuff and shuffled three tables away. I frowned as they shot dirty looks our way, well more specifically at <em>her</em>. </p>

<p>&quot;I hate people,&quot; Death said. </p>

<p>I smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine why.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s because they treat me so <em>great</em> and all. . .&quot; </p>

<p>We both chuckled. </p>

<p>I continued, &quot;You&#39;re actually pretty sweet, not that I didn&#39;t think that at first glance. I will admit that the whole wedding dress thing was a bit of a surprise.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My appearance changes for each person. What you see and what that family over there does, are completely different.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, that made sense, because if they saw what I did they&#39;d probably change their mind. </p>

<p>&quot;So, I&#39;m wearing a wedding dress, am I?&quot;  </p>

<p>I chuckled. &quot;Did I say that?&quot;  </p>

<p>Death smiled and took a sip from her cup. &quot;When I look into the mirror I see a dark cloud, it&#39;s all evil, complete and utter malice. And if I stare long enough, I see a girl, one that I don&#39;t like very much.&quot; </p>

<p>I could tell she was sharing something personal, so I decided to tread carefully. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s tough, especially when we have to face our shadows,&quot; I muttered. </p>

<p>She nodded and stared into her coffee with an absent mind. </p>

<p>&quot;You know I didn&#39;t always like myself much, especially not in the beginning,&quot; I said, remembering the torment I used to put myself through for not being able to do better with my creations. &quot;I&#39;ve created some pretty big problems, far beyond my control.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How&#39;d you get through it?&quot; Death asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I guess you&#39;ve just gotta find someone that can help you find the good in you. And take the leap when that moment comes.&quot; </p>

<p>She had her hand on the table. I slid my fingers into hers and for a moment we locked eyes in a complete still silence. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t even know your name,&quot; she whispered. </p>

<p>I thought I&#39;d already told her. &quot;I&#39;m Life.&quot; </p>

She had never been &#39;catcalled&#39; before. What do you do in such a situation? Her mind was racing now. &quot;Should she respond? And what should the response be? How is he not petrified of her now?&quot; And while her mind was at it, she was staring blankly at him. 
He was a scrawny man in his late teens. Not particularly handsome, but he had a certain anti-charm. People who walked past him got irritated by him. He was like a filter to the street. Every person who passed him in the street had visible negative emotions on their face. They hated him, or were disgusted. One older gentleman had anger on his face. He probably wanted to punch this guy&#39;s face in. Now she wanted to punch his face in. 
He kept going and now his remarks started getting more vulgar. &quot;Those melons, Ooooh.... &quot; he started making noises now. And it stirred something in her too. She hated him with all the hate inside her. And she had unlimited hatred inside her. She was from hell. She wanted to kill him. That was what she was here for. To take him with her, to save these people from him. To take him to hell. She loved to hear people like him scream in horror. People who wasted all their lives making other people miserable. 
All she had to do was touch him. She walked two steps towards him but froze. This man was not horrified of her. The reality of the situation dawned on her. When he saw her, he saw an angel. She had been called the angel of death before, but that was only a metaphor. What if he always saw her this way. She was going to take him in for eternity after all. What if she had to deal with him everyday. I&#39;m hell, there were no rooms. Everyone kept away from her out of sheer fear. This guy would never leave her. A million years of her future played out in front of her.
&quot;Hey, mami, you wanna come home with me&quot;. He blew her a kiss. She turned away and ran into the crowd. </p>

<p>The first thing Matt noticed was that color, that perfect sky-blue color of her eyes, as she walked down the street. Her jet black hair was tied back in a ponytail that bobbed back and forth as she walked, her pretty face masked in apprehension and nervousness.</p>

<p>But her eyes were blue. That was the first thing he noticed.</p>

<p>Behind her, a child cried in mortal terror as the woman approached Matt. An older woman pulled the child away, crossing herself with her free hand. Matt couldn&#39;t understand; <em>why is everyone so scared of her?</em> he thought. <em>She&#39;s beautiful.</em></p>

<p>&quot;H-hello? You can see me?&quot; she asked. Her voice was like a spring breeze; quiet and gentle.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot; Matt replied. &quot;I think everyone here can see you, miss. Uh...&quot;</p>

<p>A man in a business suit, for reasons Matt couldn&#39;t understand, took a look at the woman and voided himself. The blue-eyed woman ignored him, focusing on Matt. &quot;Everyone sees me they way they want to see me. Most people see me as repulsive. Scary. Feared. But not you.&quot;</p>

<p>Matt gave a grunt of confusion, not looking away from the woman&#39;s blue eyes. Somewhere nearby, someone asked, &quot;Dear God! What happened to <em>her?!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know why everyone&#39;s acting like that,&quot; Matt said. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I?&quot; The woman smiled; small crimson-stained lips hiding perfect white teeth. &quot;Nobody&#39;s really called me that in a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not even your parents?&quot; Matt asked, surprised. &quot;I&#39;m sure you were a beautiful baby--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; She sighed, trying to remember. Matt couldn&#39;t help but admire the way the woman&#39;s chest heaved beneath her tank top. &quot;That was a <em>very</em> long time ago, Matthew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, you know me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know everyone. Everyone who is born, everyone who ever lived. But more importantly... how everyone dies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A psychic?&quot; Matt wondered, trying to ignore the couple passing behind the woman.</p>

<p>&quot;No. Far worse. I know when everyone&#39;s time is, Matthew. I&#39;m the end of the road. Journey&#39;s end. The Midnight Train to Georgia. The last train for the coast.&quot; Smiling a bit at what she thought was a joke, the woman added, &quot;I am Death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like that woman from the comics with the bigass sword and the black leather bikini?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An impostor. And that&#39;s Lady Death. I&#39;m just plain &#39;Death.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well. Uh... pleased to meet you?&quot; Matt extended his hand, then suddenly jerked it back in shock. &quot;Wait! If I touch you, does that mean I&#39;m gonna--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not how it works, Matthew. I show up when someone&#39;s about to die, and I guide them on to What&#39;s Next.&quot; Death looked at the crowded street nervously. &quot;You can tell most people don&#39;t want to deal with me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, not many people want to really think about dying,&quot; Matt said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s sad, yes, but it&#39;s a natural part of life. Everyone meets me sooner or later,&quot; Death replied. &quot;But you&#39;re the first person to see me as a thing of beauty. Everyone else sees a desiccated skeleton with a shroud and a scythe, like I&#39;m some kind of crappy Halloween decoration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No scythe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No scythe.&quot;</p>

<p>The brown-haired man heaved a sigh of relief. &quot;Well, that&#39;s one less thing to worry about, then,&quot; he said. &quot;Does this have anything to do with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4io63l/wp_a_man_tries_to_sell_his_soul_satan_to_get_a/d32fwli" rel="nofollow">that guy who tried to summon the Devil last year?</a> Swear to God, he woke me up at three in the morning blasting the Phantom of the Opera...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Oh, that guy!&quot; Death shook her head. &quot;No. That&#39;s Satan you&#39;re thinking of. I&#39;m nothing like her.&quot;</p>

<p>Kyle chuckled. &quot;I can only imagine,&quot; he said. He again extended his hand, and Death took it. &quot;So... if you don&#39;t mind my asking, Death... what brings you here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was curious.&quot; Her blue-painted nails gently brushed his flesh as their hands shook.</p>

<p>&quot;Curious about humanity? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard all the stories--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. About <em>you.</em> It might be mere coincidence, but... you are the only person I&#39;ve met to see me as beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot; Matt wondered.</p>

<p>&quot;You are also the only person on Earth whose name is not on my list.&quot;</p>

Flickering neon lights lit alleyways where recombiners offered to fix memories and petty hustlers tried to sell pretty, real flesh; their eyes glazed over from whatever new synthetic smuggled from the less law abiding edges of Laniakea, their quivering lips betraying their faces&#39; porcelain smooth demeanor. </p>

<p>As one opened their mouth, shadowed by a dark figure all silvered teeth and eyes, I ducked before an offer could be made, weaving through the press of bodies, the doldrum that had accepted the lazily flying palaces above were only for temporary respite from the weather, and that looking up was akin to imagining being in one of the dizzyingly tall ivory towers they scraped by. </p>

<p>I knew better: as above, so below.</p>

<p>The Funded lived just as miserably in their habitats, disconnected from each other, the world, reality. Looking up at the Rings the way pedestrians looked at their towers and Vimanas Calling a two bit schmuck like me occasionally to clean up a mess of theirs, or find the source of mess (that invariably circled back to another Funded), or, rarely, create a mess at their behest. This world world was a mess, top to bottom, and no amount of glitz, gloss, or glam could polish this lump of shit enough to hide its stink. </p>

<p>My muted tulpa broke so many protocols right then that half my mind had it in the recycling bin before I noticed her. It was as though the sea of destitute had parted and I was Moses, her my promised land —</p>

<p>&quot;If you would stop monologuing for just one fucking second, there is something seriously not right-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s not right is you overriding eight security layers.&quot; Maxximus was prone to paranoia, and overthinking, and overtalking.</p>

<p>&quot;Nononononononononono,&quot; the son of a bitch overrode my mute, and went visual; a purple, muscled head of too many teeth and eyes far too slanted popping up in my periphery. &quot;This is different, I can feel -&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her...&quot; I finished his words as I stopped walking, locking eyes with an absolutely divine vision of a woman. She seemed untouched by the rain, as if it had just sizzled off of her aura before it had a chance to touch her perfect mocha skin. I was left speechless, even as Maxx&#39;s increasingly desperate and angry attempts to speak faded off into wherever tulpas went when not welcome.</p>

<p>She shocked me by reaching out. With her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re funny.&quot; She said, her voice sounded of ash and lilacs; the kind of voice that would silence a man&#39;s heart and he would thank her for the pleasure.</p>

<p>&quot;And you&#39;re beautiful,&quot; I said with a sincerity I thought I had lost in a previous century. It left a mild shock that brought me back, had me noticing the alleys with the silvered eyes, the hushed comms probing; I&#39;m slipping not to have noticed so many gates simultaneously preparing for war. I glanced quickly to where the dame with the porcelain face had been, and saw nothing but silvered teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about them. They see what they want to see; they see what I am.&quot; She said, walking towards me even as my own feet had become cement. Maxx popped out from some shop&#39;s projector array, but she waved him away so easily you would never believe he was a top dollar tulpa even the Funded envied.</p>

<p>I tried to reach out with my comms, as my lips had suddenly left me. There was nothing. And everything. I probed: <em>Who are you...?</em></p>

<p>And she rellied, <strong><em>Not who, but what.</em></strong> Now she stood so close the rain couldn&#39;t wash out her fragrance.  She was standing no more than a foot away from me. <strong><em>I am the end, and the woman that will kill you.</em></strong> </p>

<p>&quot;But you can call me Death.&quot; The beautiful smell of ash and lilacs filled my nostrils even as Maxx howled in my subconscious. I didn&#39;t think I was eager to die, but I knew I&#39;d thank her for the pleasure.</p>

Little black dress, which cut off just above her knees, and pumps to match.</p>

<p>&quot;H... hi.&quot; I stuttered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well that&#39;s a first. Normally people want to run away when they see death.&quot; She said looking up at me.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re...&quot; I stuttered, then pulling my jaw off the ground from her beauty, I got out a statement of disbelief, &quot;You&#39;re death.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You seem surprised.&quot; She said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well yeah, cause you&#39;re and please take no offense, but you&#39;re hot. I mean that kind of hot that would be in a porno, or one of my fantasies... but never as death.&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, is that how you see me? It&#39;s different for everyone.&quot; She said looking at her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s how I see you.&quot; I said. &quot;Doesn&#39;t everyone?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it&#39;s different for everyone. For most I&#39;m a cloaked figure, others, a horrific beast, but to you... you seem to see me as a porno star.&quot; She said, laughing at the last part.</p>

<p>&quot;So I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not normal that i see you that way...&quot; I said sullenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. But it&#39;s very interesting. Why don&#39;t we take a walk and we can talk and maybe we&#39;ll understand why when we&#39;re done.&quot; Death said.</p>

I blame my mom.  At least the mom in my dream I had when I was a child.  We were in our living room, surrounded by crumbling wallpaper and a frayed carpet.  Everything was normal.  Then a leather coffin appeared out of the air and my mom got in it.  She said she was dying.  </p>

<p>I wake up screaming.  </p>

<p>That dream was 15 years ago...but I remember it everytime I think of death...which is often.  It&#39;s almost like a past-time. My impending doom and the oblivion that awaits have become the silent theme song of my life. I was afraid once,  of what awaited me behind the doors of death but not anymore.  This world, with all its pain and suffering and worthlessness does make me happy anymore.  I&#39;m not sure it ever did.  I think I&#39;ve just been emulating happiness for a long time now.  Trying to act it out by observing how others seem to be &quot;happy&quot;. A smile here and a laugh there,  but I&#39;ve come to realize that,  inside,  there is nothing. That being said though,  life still has its surprises for me.  And she was one of them. </p>

<p>It was a cloudy day when we first met.  How fitting.  I was walking across the street from her when I saw her stop under a canopy of a coffee shop.  She was gorgeous.  I mean drop-dead-too-good-to-be-true gorgeous. The kind of girl that causes you pain to behold because you know you can never be with her.  I had to fucking try.  Our eyes met for just a second.  The way your eyes meet with strangers in passing but I felt like I knew her already.  Im an Idiot.  She darted into the coffee shop and I ran across the street to follow her inside.  </p>

<p>She was wearing black skin tight jeans and a black tank top.  Her &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;  snapback lay to the side of her raven dark,  curly hair. Her skin was a milk chocolaty brown and her eyes,  here is the kicker,  were starry night blue. I&#39;m a sucker for beautiful eyes. She had to be an angel.</p>

<p>She grabbed her coffee and went to sit by the window.  Gazing out into windy sidewalk.  It had started to drizzle now and rain drops fell down her window.  She wasn&#39;t with anyone and she wasn&#39;t doing anything so this was my chance to talk to her.  </p>

<p>But what do I say? </p>

<p>&quot;come here often?&quot; </p>

<p>No thats stupid. </p>

<p>Maybe a pick up line...? </p>

<p>No you fucking moron.  </p>

<p>AGGHHHH. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just go for the hello I guess.
. 
. 
. 
&quot;Hey, my name is Michael,  I saw you sitting here and I was wondering if I could join you.&quot;</p>

<p>She gestured towards the chair across the table from her. </p>

<p>&quot;So what&#39;s your name?&quot; I asked,  staring into her unnervingly beautiful eyes.  I could barely pay attention.  </p>

<p>Her full lips twisted into a smile,  revealing pearly white teeth.  I didn&#39;t think it was possible for her to get more attractive.  </p>

<p>&quot;My name is Death.  Nice to meet you Michael.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Death? Oh,  thats a cool name I guess.  Death as in dead death? Is it spelled the same as the word I&#39;m thinking of?&quot;</p>

<p>She nods. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah OK.  Cool.  Just wondering.  Just never met someone named death before ha. So uh,  are you from around here?&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled her wicked smile again.  &quot;I&#39;m not really from anywhere...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Military kid,  huh? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Hahah, not exactly. I&#39;ve just always been on the move,  no need for me to be in any place for too long if I&#39;m not needed&quot;</p>

<p>What did she mean &quot;if I&#39;m not needed&quot;.  </p>

<p>&quot;ah OK.  So what is it that requires you to move.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your bosses and stuff?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha no not really. I&#39;m more self employed than anything really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh that&#39;s awesome!  I bet it&#39;s cool getting to pick your own hours and getting to sleep in. That&#39;s bomb.  What do you do? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; I reap souls. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Uh,  sorry what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I reap souls.  I&#39;m Death.  I told you that was my name. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; What do you mean you reap souls...you can&#39;t actually be death right? I mean I thought that was just like a nickname or just a name you know your hipster parents gave you or something. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; No honey,  I&#39;m the real deal. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; But... But...you&#39;re so...where is the scythe and the hooded cloak and the skeleton?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s how I appear to most people... and those people stay away.  Haven&#39;t you noticed anything strange about this coffeshop since you and I walked in&quot;</p>

<p>I looked around and realized that everyone was looking at her strange.  Those who were walking by were doing their utmost to be as far away from us as possible.  Their eyes were a mix of disgust and terror and they were all looking at her. </p>

<p>I turn to look back at her and she&#39;s smiling. She looks at me and says &quot;Hey,  this place is bumming me out, wanna get out of here?&quot; </p>

<p>This beautiful woman? Goddess?  Monster?-Let&#39;s stick with woman for now - wanted to spend more time with me. Call me shallow but I was captivated...even if she was actually death.  That would actually make it better.  How many times has anyone seen death and lived to tell the tale. </p>

<p>I nod and get up to leave. </p>

<p>&quot;where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, the door. You said you wanted to get outta here...&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed while shaking her head.  &quot;I have a better way&quot; </p>

<p>And before she even finished her sentence,  we were transported to a completely different place. </p>

<p>Will continue later.  Written on phone so sorry for the mistakes. </p>

Smelling of gasoline, hot dogs, and piss the city felt alive again. I could hear people chatting about their day, their stocks and bonds, their children, and even the schizo&#39;s were having wonderful conversations. It had been a good day for me. I was walking the street just coming from a varied-medium art class and felt great about what we had talked about a few hours earlier. The art teacher had talked about darkness. She asked us if we could find beauty in some of the darker parts of life. Our assignment for the week was to come up with a beauty in darkness project. Use our favorite medium to portray the beauty in the darkness of human life. It intrigued me. So I walked the street with my camera and snapped a few photos of the more dark and dangerous parts of town. Plenty of my favorites were from under the east street bridge. Even all the homeless folk looked...at peace.</p>

<p>Just as I turned the corner heading down the street my apartment was on I saw a strange sight. The stream I had been moving against suddenly opened up around someone sitting againssquatirty wall. I could hear gasps and gags, scoffs of disgust and ews from the passers by. I pushed through the crowd and looked at what everyone was avoiding. Could it be another beauty in darkness shot?
What I saw was very different. It was a girl. She was about may age, maybe 22 or 23. Wearing a knee length white dress and no shoes. Her dark brown hair obscured her face slightly but I could tell she had a beautiful facial structure. I squated down a few feet from her. Her legs were crossed out in front of her and her hands folded in her lap. Her skin looked flawless but quite dirty.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay, miss?&quot; I inquired.
She pointed to herself very slowly.
&quot;Yes, you. Is everything alright?&quot;
&quot;Why are speaking to me?&quot; Her voice was so beautiful it made me drop my jaw.
&quot;Uhm...well...you&#39;re just sitting here on the street. Do you need any help? Do you have a place to go?&quot;
The people walking by were whispering to themselves and others but I couldn&#39;t make it out. I knew it was about me talking to the girl though. I had no idea why.
&quot;I have no home.&quot; she said.
&quot;No home? How about food? Do you need food?&quot;
&quot;I do not eat.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t eat, either.&quot; I looked around to find people looking at me in horror.
&quot;Why is everyone looking at you like that? Looks like they&#39;re scared of you.&quot; I knelt down in front of her.
&quot;Why are YOU not scared of me?&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s there to be scared of?&quot;
&quot;I am not like you.&quot;
&quot;Is that such a bad thing?&quot;
&quot;Humans think so.&quot;
Humans? What was she talking about?
I took a moment to respond. &quot;What do you mean humans? You&#39;re a human.&quot;
&quot;I am not.&quot;
What the fuck? Another schizo I thought.
&quot;Okay well then what are you?&quot;
&quot;I am death.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re death? Right.&quot;
She looked me in the eyes and I finally got a good look at her face.</p>

<p>Her deep green eyes were piercing and cold. Dead almost. Her lips were dark and slightly blue. Skin was soft and pale. She was gorgeous. Absolutely amazingly gorgeous. I gasped. She was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen.
As our eyes met I knew that she was telling the truth. I don&#39;t know how but she conveyed the darkest reality she could through those cold dead eyes. She looked back down after a few seconds.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re death. How? How are you real?&quot; I squeaked out.
&quot;I was banished to the material world. Now humans see me the same way they feel about death. Everyone is scared but you.&quot;
Death. The most beautiful woman I had ever seen. How? Why? I still don&#39;t understand.
&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful though. How do people see you differently than I do?&quot; I said.
She looked back up at me.
&quot;Beautiful? How do you see me as beautiful?&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know but you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>I ended up taking her back to my apartment and I could tell people saw me walking with what they saw as a monster.
She showered and I washed her dress. Somehow she smelled of calla lillies. Naturally, I assumed, because I have no lilly fragrances in my apartment. I gave her some of my exes clothes which I never got around to giving back and surprisingly they fit her.
We talked for hours and we got to know each other. She thought it would be a good idea to have a human name: Thana.</p>

<p>I asked to take photos of her and she obliged.
I had hoped that I could capture the beauty in her being the human embodiment of death.
I showed the rest of my class the photos of my project, saving Thana&#39;s for last. The entire class had different reactions for the photo. Mostly negative. I assume it was because it was a really great picture but the subject was hideous to them.
It was hideous to all of my classmates...
Excpet the one girl whom I had a crush on.</p>

<p>She thought it was beautiful.
She thought DEATH was beautiful as I did.</p>

<p>1932, east-side Manhattan, and the colors meshed to grey as the weather worsened. Carly Fiorina, nimble and tight, sashayed the streets, weaving expertly the throngs of simple-minds and weak engines. </p>

<p>Donkey and Shrek, recently on their lunch burkas (yes they&#39;re practicing Mooslims), grabbed Fiorina, saving her from the grasp and worry of dirty streets and a harrowing career at Hewlett-Packard. She bleached her skin green as a sign of solidarity to her rippling foreign savior. This freaked people out pretty big-league, so they recoiled from her.</p>
