she speaks, Madeleine Lancaster rests her hand on her pregnant belly. &ldquo;Oh they&rsquo;re about six or seven months along now&rdquo;. At this point her progeny measure about four millimetres across. She&rsquo;s growing a few hundred, and each has around two million neurons already.</p><p>Fortunately, she&rsquo;s not talking about an enormous brood of unborn babies &ndash; though she is expecting one normal human. No, this scientist is referring to a batch of developing human brains.</p><p>We&rsquo;re in the MRC&rsquo;s brand new molecular biology lab in Cambridge &ndash; a sprawling warren of glass-fronted laboratories, space-age equipment and hallways which seem to stretch for miles. It&rsquo;s not secret or underground, but the &pound;212m building is home to a number of futuristic projects worthy of their own Hollywood movie.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z39b\"}}</p><p>In her own small corner of this research utopia, Madeleine&rsquo;s team is at work on a task so absurd it seems more wizardly than scientific: they&rsquo;re transforming human skin into brains.</p><p>&ldquo;The brains develop in the same way you would see in an embryo,&rdquo; says Madeleine. This may be true, but their surroundings are rather different. In place of a womb, the disembodied brains are raised in giant incubators. Without a blood supply they are fed with a nutrient-rich fluid which is refreshed every few days. And, of course, they don&rsquo;t have an immune system: everything &ndash; <em>everything</em> &ndash; which comes into contact with them must be disinfected first with alcohol.</p><blockquote><p> Just like regular brains, each is composed of specific regions </p></blockquote><p>When she opens the incubator door &ndash; well, I have to admit they don&rsquo;t look as impressive as I&rsquo;d imagined: insipid, watery blobs floating in a pool of pale pink liquid. They look more like bits of waterlogged popcorn than powerhouses of intellectual ability.</p><p>But their looks are deceiving. In fact these &ldquo;cerebral organoids&rdquo;, as they have been christened, are strikingly similar to the brains of ordinary people. Just like any other brain, the organoids are divided into grey matter &ndash; which is made of neurons &ndash; and white matter, a fatty tissue composed of their spindly &lsquo;tails&rsquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z2nt\"}}</p><p>And just like regular brains, each is composed of specific regions. There&rsquo;s the wrinkled cortex (thought to be the seat of language and conscious thought) the hippocampus (the centre of emotion and memory), the ancient, muscle-coordinating cerebellum, and many, many others. In all, they are equivalent to the brains of nine-week-old foetuses.</p><p>So how are they made?</p><blockquote><p> With a few simple ingredients &ndash; and an unquenchable enthusiasm for drenching things in alcohol &ndash; you too could have a miniature brain in a matter of months </p></blockquote><p>In fact, making a brain isn&rsquo;t as difficult as you might expect. With a few simple ingredients &ndash; and an unquenchable enthusiasm for drenching things in alcohol &ndash; you too could have a miniature brain in a matter of months.</p><p>First off, you&rsquo;ll need some cells. Lancaster&rsquo;s team took theirs from samples of donated skin but, somewhat disconcertingly, to make this masterpiece of human evolution you could start with any cell type &ndash; be it nose, liver, or toenail.</p><p>Only stem cells are able to develop into all the body&rsquo;s tissues, so next you&rsquo;ll need to turn your cells into some of those. For this, the team used a kind of cellular youth serum, a protein cocktail which can rewind the clock and turn any cell back into an embryonic-like state.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z266\"}}</p><p>After about a week of growth, you should end up with a sheet of cells which can be scraped off the petri dish and moulded into a ball.</p><p>Lancaster takes out what looks like an empty dish of pink liquid. &ldquo;You can see them in there &ndash; they are tiny at this point,&rdquo; she says. Sure enough, each well contains a white dot about the size of a comma. &ldquo;They kind of want to become an embryo,&rdquo; she says. (Watch the video below to see more.)</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p048sv4b\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>Eventually each stem cell will begin to specialise, turning the uniform balls into a jumble of different cell types. Among them will be brain cells.</p><p>To begin with, the researchers are doting parents, keeping their embryos fed and encouraging them to continue to grow. But they aren&rsquo;t spoilt for long. Next the balls of cells are transferred to a new dish, this time with very little food. As the cells begin to starve, most of them will die off, leaving only the brain cells behind. &ldquo;They are really robust &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows why,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> The brains are constantly buzzing with electrical activity as neurons zap off signals to one another </p></blockquote><p>Finally, the developing brains are enveloped in a blanket of jelly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the opposite of normal jelly &ndash; it starts off as a liquid which you pour on and it jellifies as it warms up in the incubator,&rdquo; she says. The jelly mimics the tissue a brain would normally be surrounded with in an embryo &ndash; like a makeshift skull &ndash; and encourages them to develop relatively normally.</p><p>Then all you have to do is sit back and wait. Three months later, the finished product is about four millimetres across and contains around two million neurons. &ldquo;A fully developed, adult mouse brain only contains four million, so you can do a lot with that number,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The brains are constantly buzzing with electrical activity as neurons zap off signals to one another &ndash; though Lancaster says this isn&rsquo;t much of an achievement on her part. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very special but it does tell us that we are making functional neurons and that they are acting like neurons,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>She compares it to the heart cells which scientists coaxed to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BqzW9Jq-OVA\">beat inside a petri dish</a> back in 2013; while heart cells are programmed to &ldquo;want&rdquo; to pump, neurons &ldquo;want&rdquo; to fire. &ldquo;Even if you have a neuron by itself in a dish with no other neurons, it wants to fire so badly that it will connect to itself in order to fire,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z11y\"}}</p><p>At the moment, Lancaster&rsquo;s brains aren&rsquo;t thought to be able to think. Nobody understands how the activity of our brains gives rise to thoughts &ndash; and it&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to define what a thought actually is &ndash; but it might go something like this. Usually, when we&rsquo;re exposed to stimulation from the outside world &ndash; smells, sounds, ideas &ndash; our brains store the information by strengthening the connections between our neurons or forming new ones. The average adult will have as many as 1,000 trillion, which together give our brains an equivalent processing power to a one trillion-bit-per-second computer.</p><p>And here&rsquo;s the rub. Even with all the same components as regular brains, without a body to provide information about the world around them, the brains simply can&rsquo;t develop normally. &ldquo;The neurons are working but they aren&rsquo;t really organised relative to one another,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Lancaster gives the example of people who are born blind. &ldquo;Since they aren&rsquo;t exposed to light, the part of the brain that [these signals] would normally connect up is actually not going to form,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> The team has been taking individual genes involved in brain development and replacing them with the chimpanzee version &ndash; then using these cells to make hybrid chimp-human brains </p></blockquote><p>If you hooked lab-grown brains up to an EEG, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t see anything. The so-called &ldquo;brain waves&rdquo; which the machines can detect occur as a result of millions of neurons firing in synchrony; when combined, their electrical signals are detectable through the scalp.</p><p>&ldquo;This is kind of a good thing, I think. I&rsquo;d have some issues if I thought there was proper network formation there,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>But making conscious brains was never part of the plan. Instead, Lancaster is using hers to answer a decades-old mystery: for all our intellectual superiority, the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics\">genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees</a> is around 1.2%. That&rsquo;s only 12 times higher than the differences between individual humans (0.1%). Why?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z0ft\"}}</p><p>To find out, the team has been taking individual genes involved in brain development and replacing them with the chimpanzee version &ndash; then using these cells to make hybrid chimp-human brains. As they develop, the role of the gene often becomes clear; the brains with the chimpanzee gene may be significantly smaller than ordinary human brains, or contain fewer neurons, for example.</p><p>In other words, the brains allow researchers to do experiments they would normally never be allowed to do (imagine the controversy if a chimpanzee gene was added to an actual human).</p><p>Eventually, Lancaster hopes to do the opposite version of the experiments with lab-grown chimpanzee brains, too. This is tricky, because they are a protected species &ndash; you can&rsquo;t just walk up to a chimpanzee and take a piece of skin &ndash; but they&rsquo;ve found an alternative, if fairly unglamorous, supply of cells. &ldquo;If an animal has a baby in a zoo, they would normally just throw away the placenta, but we can take these leftovers,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> Several groups are working on improving the brains, introducing a blood supply so that they can grow larger </p></blockquote><p>Elsewhere, the organoids are being used to study uniquely human diseases, from autism to schizophrenia. Historically, it was difficult to study their causes in the lab because &ndash; by their very definition &ndash; no other animal can get them.</p><p>Take autism. Severely autistic children aren&rsquo;t able to speak &ndash; how can you study this disorder in a mouse if it was never able to speak in the first place?</p><p>By comparing brains grown from the skin of normal adults and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186191\">autistic patients</a>, last year scientists were able to show that the disease may be caused by an imbalance of the two main types of neuron, those which initiate signals (excitatory neurons), and those which act as a brake (inhibitory neurons).</p><p>&ldquo;In a normal brain there&rsquo;s a very fine balance between those two types, so you could imagine this could have a big impact on the way the networks function,&rdquo; says Lancaster.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p049z1lq\"}}</p><p>The real breakthrough is that not only can the brains simulate these disorders, but they allow scientists to go back in time and work out why the autistic brains are different. &ldquo;You can watch them over time and find out at what point during their development they start to look different. Well of course you can&rsquo;t normally do that,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The man-made brains are already transforming our understanding of the brain, its disorders and what makes humans special. Though they were only invented in 2013, a quick Google search of &ldquo;cerebral organoids&rdquo; turns up 2,820 scientific papers already.</p><p>So what does the future hold? Several groups are working on improving the brains, introducing a blood supply so that they can grow larger; at the moment, the 4mm brains are entirely reliant on Oxygen and nutrients diffusing in from the surrounding liquid.</p><p>For many scientists, the ultimate goal is for the brains to function like normal brains &ndash; forming networks which can be stained, sliced up and studied like the brains of lab mice.

Could the same thing happen to our crops and other foodstuffs too?</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that farmers in many parts of the world are going to find things harder in the coming decades. Last week, BBC Future explored one scientist&rsquo;s efforts to help crops cope with the increased likelihood of droughts. By using the genes from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151220-could-resurrection-plants-be-the-future-of-food\">&ldquo;resurrection plants&rdquo;</a>, Jill Farrant of the University of Cape Town is exploring whether she can design crops to survive for much longer periods without water.</p><p>Watch the video below to see how resurrection plants can come back from the dead, after months or even years:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p03chg6k\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>But if we can&rsquo;t find ways to protect other foods, will they survive climate change? Fortunately, there is some good news on this front. Despite <a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/photos/6-foods-are-going-extinct-because-climate-change/fish\">alarmist headlines</a> about &ldquo;foods that are going extinct,&rdquo; there is no evidence that major food types like beans, chocolate, wine, corn or wheat will cease to exist.</p><p>&ldquo;A crop itself, no, it won't go extinct,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://ccafs.cgiar.org/about/who-we-are/our-staff/researchers/theme-leader/andrew-jarvis#.VnmxCxqDGko\">Andrew Jarvis</a>, a flagship leader on the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. &ldquo;Somewhere in the world, it will grow.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Foods are unlikely to disappear under climate change, but that&rsquo;s not the whole story </p></blockquote><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s all good news for future food. We will probably have to change where we grow certain crops, as some regions get too hot. The downside, obviously, is that local farmers will suffer under this scenario. And some people may struggle to get the same access to certain foods. &ldquo;Even if overall food production may be unaffected, food security can still be impacted,&rdquo; says Margaret Walsh, an ecologist at the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Climate Change Program Office. In other words, even if a certain food is still grown on some corner of the Earth, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone will continue to have the same degree of access as today.</p><p>Overall, the yields of many foods, from staples to life-enhancing extras such as coffee and chocolate, will likely be impacted by climate change too. How those diminishments will be felt will depend on the degree of warming and the crop in question, but in general, &ldquo;anything over about 30C is very bad for crops,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/wolfram-schlenker\">Wolfram Schlenker</a>, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. For example, statistical studies that he and a colleague built of corn and soybean production in the US show a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.full\">steep decline</a> after crossing the 30C temperature threshold.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p46\"}}</p><p>In the US &ndash; the world&rsquo;s largest producer of corn and soybeans &ndash; farms can move north to some degree, Schlenker says. But eventually, yields will likely suffer because the soil north of Iowa declines in quality &ndash; a legacy of glacial expansion. Other studies, including of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n3/full/nclimate1356.html\">wheat in India</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n1/full/nclimate1043.html\">maize in Africa</a>, also found that there is a threshold above which yields sharply decline: crops can adapt and move, but only to a point. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s common to all studies is the finding that extreme heat is detrimental to crop growth, although exact cutoffs vary by crop,&rdquo; Schlenker says. &ldquo;If predictions for the end of the century are true, though, I think a lot of agricultural areas in the US will see significant hits.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> 80% of coffee-growing zones in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Under current conditions, about 4% of the world&rsquo;s croplands experience drought in any given year, but by the end of the century <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00363.1\">those conditions are projected</a> to jump to about 18% per year. <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/effects_2012/effects_agriculture.htm\">Some studies</a> indicate that horticulture crops &ndash; generally, everything besides staples &ndash; may be impacted most severely, largely because they tend to be constrained to a smaller geographic area. Jarvis and his colleagues found that <a href=\"http://www.ciatnews.cgiar.org/2015/10/27/climate-change-scientists-pinpoint-the-worlds-most-vulnerable-coffee-zones/\">80% of coffee-growing zones</a> in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050, for example, while climate change will likely have &ldquo;profound impacts&rdquo; on <a href=\"http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/?appid=eb683a0093974045b6d7c1b8fa7750fd\">cocoa production in West Africa</a>. &ldquo;High quality chocolate will be less available in the future, and if you want it, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a lot more for it,&rdquo; Jarvis says. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p65\"}}</p><p>This means that, for those who can afford it, some foods will simply cost them more in the future. But for poorer people, those same price jumps will likely cause certain foods to go extinct from their diets. &ldquo;The more you reduce, the shorter the supply, and the higher the price will jump,&rdquo; Schlenker says.</p><blockquote><p> High quality chocolate will be less available in the future, and if you want it, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a lot more for it </p></blockquote><p>Another potential climate change-induced hitch is our dependence on commodity crops &ndash; wheat, soybeans, maize and rice &ndash; which currently provide humanity with 75% of its calories, either directly or indirectly through the animals we raise on those crops. Jarvis and his colleagues also found that, over the past five decades, the world has seen <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/11/4001\">an increasing standardisation of diets</a>; the foods we eat globally today are 36% more similar than they were in 1961. While this can be good news for the world&rsquo;s poorest people who now consume more calories, protein and fat than in the past, homogeneity and over-dependence on a handful of staples leaves us vulnerable to threats such as drought, disease and pests &ndash; all of which are predicted to worsen in many parts of the world as a result of climate change.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p9w\"}}</p><p>There are ways we could soften the coming blow to the global food supply, however. Like Farrant&rsquo;s work with resurrection crops (see video at the top of this story), a number of companies, organisations and researchers, including the <a href=\"http://dtma.cimmyt.org/index.php/component/content/article/113-news-release/154-climate-ready-maize-gets-a-boost-phase-iii-of-the-drought-tolerant-maize-in-africa-project-to-reach-more-farmers\">Gates Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/droughtgard-hybrids.aspx\">Monsanto</a>, are aiming to create drought- and temperature-resistant crops through genetic engineering and conventional breeding. For now, the jury is still out as to how successful those endeavours will be. &ldquo;The people at Monsanto who I&rsquo;ve talked to are much more optimistic that they&rsquo;ll be able to engineer heat-tolerant crops,&rdquo; Schlenker says. &ldquo;On the other hand, scientists at the USDA who I&rsquo;ve spoken with are much more cautious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Genetic engineering is one solution that we should keep developing, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a panacea that will solve everything,&rdquo; Jarvis adds. &ldquo;The evidence gathered over the last 10 years is that it hasn&rsquo;t totally revolutionised agriculture.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3pfx\"}}</p><p>Until genetic engineering comes to fruition, other strategies might also help in some places, including applying more fertiliser, implementing better irrigation, using machinery that gets crops out of the field faster or installing storage facilities to stave off spoilage. &ldquo;Many places could benefit a great deal just by using technologies that already exist,&rdquo; Walsh says. &ldquo;General agronomic management can go a long way toward mitigating changes.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, diversifying our diet away from heat-sensitive wheat, corn, rice and other crops could also help. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen profound changes in the last decades in what we eat largely as a result of international trade, and I think that trend toward more diversification will continue,&rdquo; Jarvis says. &ldquo;Depending on a greater number of plant species creates a more resilient, less risky food system &ndash; and one that provides a broader range of nutritional requirements.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>&nbsp;<em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"<p>This is part of a series called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, about amazing and sometimes little-known technological breakthroughs, and the innovative minds behind them.</p>","CalloutPosition":"bottom","CalloutSubtitle":"Be inspired by great minds and ideas","CalloutTitle":"The Genius Behind","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-12-28T08:12:46.431Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Here’s how climate change will affect what you eat","HeadlineShort":"Will climate change make foods extinct?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Could some foods go extinct, or is the threat exaggerated?

It was obvious that the animal had collided with a ship &ndash; but why? Only later, after methodically surveying the whales which lived in the area and measuring the increase of sound pollution from ships did it become clear that there was a link.</p><blockquote><p> There&rsquo;s a world of sound and animal communication never observed with such clarity before </p></blockquote><p>The whales had become desensitised to the noise of approaching boats and were being struck by them, often fatally. &ldquo;We never thought that this could be something that could kill,&rdquo; recalls Andre, who is the director of the Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics at the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035dwph\"}}&nbsp;</p><p>Andre has spent 20 years developing an advanced system for listening to subsea noise in order to better understand why incidents like this happen. His underwater microphones, or hydrophones, have exposed a world of sound and animal communication never observed with such clarity before.</p><p><em>Watch Andre collecting and decoding the sounds in the video below:</em></p><p>{\"video\":{\"pid\": \"p0350fmw\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\"}}</p><p>The elaborate listening apparatus developed by Andre for detecting sound in the ocean is dubbed &ldquo;smart ears&rdquo;. It not only detects the voices of whales, dolphins and other creatures, but also the deafening whirr of boats, propellers and other marine machinery.</p><p>It was not an easy task. Sound waves don&rsquo;t travel through water in the uniform, predictable way they do through the air. Instead, the temperature, salinity and flow of the water column &ndash; among other things &ndash; dramatically impact their path.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035dxgt\"}}</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of distortion, so Andre and his team had to develop algorithms that could analyse the sounds in real-time and match them to a database of known ocean noises: everything from whale song to dolphin-speak. No two sounds are the same, but the algorithms are clever enough to pick out similarities in the audio waves and match them with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</p><p>Andre&rsquo;s system can also estimate how far away the sound source is by interpreting how distorted the sound itself has become &ndash; partly an indicator of how much water it has travelled through before reaching the hydrophone. The quality of sound, of course, is also dependent on the movement of the animal that made it. &ldquo;If the animal turns its head you will not get the same sound or the same intensity,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035dwvn\"}}</p><blockquote><p> After taking tissue samples from the ears of beached whales, evidence of harm was found in the cells of those sensory organs </p></blockquote><p>A range of hydrophones, on buoys monitored by Andre, is now picking up audio signals in seas all around the world. And the computer analysis is done extremely quickly &ndash; according to Andre there&rsquo;s just a three-second delay between picking up the sound and predicting algorithmically what it is. Then, the result is transmitted back to the shore.</p><p>&ldquo;We are overloaded with information,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 24/7 &ndash; data coming from over 100 channels around the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Andre&rsquo;s team aren&rsquo;t just listening &ndash; they have also studied the physiological damage caused to animals by noise. After taking tissue samples from the ears of beached whales, evidence of harm was found in the cells of those sensory organs. This, then, was why creatures had lost their ability to detect the noise of ships.</p><p>&ldquo;If there are some missing structures of these cells, it means that the animal cannot codify any more the sound that corresponds to this specific cell,&rdquo; he explains.</p><p>The kind of noise that whales and other marine animals have to contend with is not trivial, ranging from ship sounds to loud explosions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035dwzp\"}}&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Willes Clark, a bioacoustician at Cornell University (who is not involved with Andre&rsquo;s work), says ships easily drown out the noise of whale songs and the animals are also exposed to deafening explosions caused by subsea oil and gas exploration surveys.</p><p>&ldquo;We set off extremely loud explosions every 10 seconds for months at a time such that I can hear a prospecting survey going on near Ireland &ndash; I can hear that off Virginia,&rdquo; says Clark.</p><blockquote><p> One solution is to divert shipping routes to courses where ships are statistically less likely to encounter marine mammals </p></blockquote><p>What can be done? One solution is to divert shipping routes to courses where ships are statistically less likely to encounter marine mammals. It&rsquo;s also possible, sometimes, to slow down to 10 knots an hour (18km/h) or less, which is less likely to fatally injure a whale. Clark explains that this leads to a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; reduction in the chances of an animal collision.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035dx55\"}}</p><p>As for tackling the root cause of the problem, the UN&rsquo;s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has <a href=\"http://sea-inc.net/2014/04/16/imo-adopts-guidelines-to-reduce-underwater-noise-from-commercial-ships/\">already published guidelines on how to quieten ships</a>, but it will be a while before the impact of such changes might be observed in the wild. Plus, businesses and vessel operators will have to co-operate.</p><p>&ldquo;The ocean is not our world,&rdquo; comments Andre. But it is ours to look after.

Scientists and doctors have long turned to body fluids for clues about our health, but now they&rsquo;re finding that they can reveal more about the hidden workings of our bodies than once realised &ndash; and what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s becoming ever-easier to test them ourselves.</p><p>Last week, for instance, BBC Future covered the story of a Star Trek-like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151204-how-one-woman-made-a-tricorder-that-could-change-medicine\">tricorder</a> that promises to diagnose fatal diseases like Ebola before people are even aware they&rsquo;re infected, and without them needing to travel long distances. Watch the video below to find out more:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p03b2fcm\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>It&rsquo;s not the only technology that allows for complex testing outside hospitals either: devices like the Cue are being marketed that will enable self-testing for fertility, flu and signs of inflammation. And the X-Prize Foundation is currently running a prize to discover <a href=\"http://tricorder.xprize.org/\">the next generation of medical tricorders</a>, capable of diagnosing various illnesses.</p><p>The next five to 10 years is expected to yield many more such tests, as well as the recruitment of new sources of information &ndash; including some our more embarrassing excretions.</p><p>As you might expect, many of these kits will involve the testing of blood. &ldquo;In blood you can detect just about everything that you&rsquo;ve eaten, or that&rsquo;s going on in your body,&rdquo; says Guy Carpenter, reader in oral biology at Kings College London.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s possible that technology will emerge to measure other excretions, says George Preti at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. He is currently investigating what your earwax can say about you. Unlike blood, earwax is a fatty substance, which means certain molecules may concentrate there and be easier to detect than in more watery fluids. &ldquo;If you have a certain group of metabolites that like to dissolve in lipids (fats), we may be able to look at them in earwax,&rdquo; Preti says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03bv1pm\"}}</p><blockquote><p> The earwax of people of East Asian descent smells different to that of European, African or American descent </p></blockquote><p>For example, maple syrup urine disorder, a genetic condition in which people can&rsquo;t break down certain parts of proteins, can be diagnosed by sniffing earwax: &ldquo;It smells of maple syrup,&rdquo; says Preti. He recently published research revealing that the earwax of people of East Asian descent smells different to that of European, African or American descent, as does their body odour. &ldquo;We already have an indication that there is some disease-related information in earwax; there&rsquo;s also information about where you&rsquo;ve been and what you&rsquo;ve eaten.&rdquo; Whether earwax will turn out to be more useful than blood and other body fluids for diagnosing certain conditions remains to be seen, but &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know unless we investigate it,&rdquo; Preti points out.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s sweat. For decades it has been used to screen newborns for cystic fibrosis, which alters the balance of sodium and chloride in their sweat. Now, <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/sweat-sensors-will-change-how-wearables-track-your-health\">wearable patches are being developed</a> that could alert athletes to changes in the balance of electrolytes that might signal that they&rsquo;re about to &ldquo;crash&rdquo; because of dehydration or physical exertion. One advantage of monitoring sweat is that it could be done passively &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to stick yourself with a needle, or even mess about with swabs - an electronic sweat-sensor could be worn under clothing that transmits information wirelessly, without you even having to think about it. &nbsp;</p><p>But there may also be limitations. &ldquo;Sweat contains marker molecules, but they are very, very variable, which will probably preclude their direct clinical use,&rdquo; cautions Jeremy Nicholson, chair in biological chemistry at Imperial College London. Its composition is also influenced by the activity of microbes living on our skin. Blood, on the other hand, tends to provide a more accurate picture of what&rsquo;s happening inside the body, as it infiltrates every tissue, and the body keeps its basic composition in strict check.</p><p>Even within a drop of blood, there&rsquo;s still a great deal more information that might be gleaned than is currently possible. For instance, Manfred Kayser at Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands is currently developing new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19566022\">DNA tests that might enable a person&rsquo;s age, physical appearance, and geographic origin</a>, to be predicted from a blood sample, which could help police identify criminal suspects or badly decomposed bodies. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03bv1mj\"}}</p><p>Some of the greatest excitement surrounds the potential predictive power of the micro-organisms living within and upon us. &ldquo;We think that at least a third of the metabolites in our blood are being produced by our microbes,&rdquo; says Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College London and author of The Diet Myth. And it&rsquo;s becoming apparent that they are influencing our health in hitherto unimaginable ways. For instance, the mood-altering chemical serotonin isn&rsquo;t only produced by your brain cells; it turns out that certain gut bacteria produce it too, and they may therefore play a role in depression.</p><blockquote><p> I&rsquo;d be able to tell much more about you from your poo than your DNA &ndash; Tim Spector, researcher </p></blockquote><p>The best place to look for changes in your bacterial flora though, is poo. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you gave me your poo sample and your DNA sample, I&rsquo;d be able to tell much more about you from your poo than your DNA,&rdquo; says Spector. This is because although the genes of any two people are approximately 99.9% similar, we only have 10-20% of our microbes in common.&nbsp; And recent research suggests the type of microbes in our guts &ndash; and therefore our poo &ndash; are influenced by what we eat, and where we&rsquo;ve been living. &ldquo;We can identify the differences between Europeans, Africans and South Americans, and we have some early data from twins showing differences between those who live in Scotland and those that live in England,&rdquo; Spector says.</p><p>Not only could analysing our poo for microbes and the chemicals they produce help tease apart complex diseases like depression and obesity and diabetes, it could also provide an early warning that an elderly person is becoming dangerously frail and needs additional support. &ldquo;As elderly people go downhill, they have a marked rise in certain gut microbes, or a lack of others,&rdquo; says Spector.</p><p>As these new sources of information mature, and the cost of analysis decreases, more self-testing kits are inevitable. Some believe this will democratise healthcare, reducing the need for people to travel, and enabling them to monitor and take greater responsibility for their own health. But it could also result in unnecessary worry and false leads. &ldquo;We can give people tests for various things, but the interpretation of those tests will still require the guidance of a health professional,&rdquo; Carpenter points out. Issues of privacy may also come to the fore. For now at least, few of us pay much regard to what happens to our secretions and emanations once they leave our bodies.</p><p>Yet for better or worse, soon a small sample of your blood, sweat, and even your earwax will be all that&rsquo;s necessary to reveal a great deal about your behaviour, health and more.</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em><strong>LinkedIn</strong></em></a> <em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-12-14T00:12:52Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The future of medicine is testing our body fluids at home","HeadlineShort":"What your body fluids say about you","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"From earwax to faeces, your secretions have secrets.

Last week in our series &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>&rdquo;, we told the story of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151108-if-alien-life-exists-on-exoplanets-how-would-we-know\">Sara Seager, a scientist looking for signs of life on second Earths</a>, who believes that the key is to scrutinise the atmospheres of these alien worlds. Find out why in the film below:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p037bfm3\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>One of the technologies that could help researchers like Seager achieve their goal is a seemingly crazy flower-shaped contraption called Starshade. It&rsquo;s a sort of giant space parasol designed to block light from a star, allowing a telescope to avoid the star's glare and peer into the planets in orbit &ndash; and, possibly, reveal signs of alien life.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384md6\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;If we want to find a true Earth twin in the near future &ndash; like in the next decade or two &ndash; then yes, we definitely need to do the Starshade,&rdquo; says Seager, who is based at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p><p>That&rsquo;s because a Sun-like star is 10 billion times brighter than an Earth-sized planet. The only hope astronomers have for glimpsing any hint of life &ndash; likely some form of microorganism &ndash; would be to somehow block the light from such a star, allowing a telescope to directly observe the planet itself. It&rsquo;s a strategy radically different from the main way astronomers have discovered and studied planets so far.<strong> <br /></strong></p><p>Because planets are so distant, small, and faint, astronomers have mostly probed them indirectly &ndash; for example by detecting dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of its star or by measuring how the star wobbles when a planet&rsquo;s gravity tugs on it. But alien-hunting demands a new tactic.</p><p>Scientists hope to identify the gases in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, and detect chemicals that suggest the presence of life &ndash; chemicals like oxygen, which comprises 20% of Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384mbb\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Without life &ndash; plants or photosynthetic bacteria &ndash; we would have virtually no oxygen,&rdquo; Seager says. Which is why oxygen is one of the most promising so-called biosignatures. But life on Earth produces all kinds of gases, and alien life could be even more diverse. The challenge is in determining whether these chemicals are biological in origin. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Although no-one&rsquo;s found any signs of life yet, astronomers have already sniffed out some atmospheres </p></blockquote><p>Although no-one&rsquo;s found any signs of life yet, astronomers have already sniffed out some atmospheres. When a planet passes in front of its star, the starlight penetrates the gaseous layer enveloping the planet. The molecules in the atmosphere absorb specific wavelengths of light, depending on what the chemical is. By measuring which wavelengths are absorbed, astronomers can identify the gases.</p><p>Bigger telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, slated for launch in 2018, will be able to use this transit technique to resolve atmospheric chemistry in greater detail. It could even conceivably detect biosignatures. &ldquo;It could get lucky,&rdquo; Siegler says. But this method is only good for planetary systems around small stars called M dwarfs &ndash; not around Sun-like stars.</p><p>Which is why astronomers like Seager want to make Starshade a reality. The video below shows how it might work in space, as well as a timelapse of the instrument unfurling on Earth.</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p0384lcm\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>The Starshade is launched with a telescope, and when it reaches its position in deep space, it will unfurl and expand to a diameter as wide as 34m (112ft). The petals, which will likely be razor-sharp, remove the effects of diffraction, in which light waves bend around the edge of the shade and produce unwanted glare. The shade and telescope will then separate by as much as 50,000 kilometres (31,250 miles) &ndash; almost four times the diameter of Earth.</p><p>Suffice to say, this isn't easy. But researchers have shown the idea to work with experiments in the desert, using a lamp, a model Starshade, and a camera. Jeremy Kasdin of Princeton University, one of the leaders of the Starshade project, is conducting lab tests with a miniature model to scale &ndash; the setup stretches for 78m (257ft), with a Starshade about five centimetres wide.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384lt0\"}}</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384lvt\"}}</p><p>If the project gets enough funding and all goes well, Nasa could launch Starshade as early as 2026. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see right now any technical impediments to complete a Starshade and flying it in the 2020s,&rdquo; Kasdin says.</p><p>But Starshade isn&rsquo;t the only way to block starlight. Its launch could coincide with WFIRST, a next-generation space telescope that&rsquo;s planned to be fitted with an instrument called a coronagraph, which blocks starlight from inside the telescope. &ldquo;We want multiple approaches in case one doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Siegler says.</p><p>A coronagraph is a tried-and-tested technology &ndash; first developed in the 1930s to study the outer layers of the sun called the corona &ndash; and could also find Earth&rsquo;s twin. But, Siegler says, the technology isn&rsquo;t there yet.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384m66\"}}</p><p>Coronagraphs are complex and fragile instruments, which make them susceptible to the Sun&rsquo;s heat and vibrations from things like the telescope&rsquo;s reaction wheels used to orient the spacecraft. Anything that can knock the telescope off-kilter means stray starlight gets into the camera, ruining the observations. Deformable mirrors can cancel out some distortions, but the current systems can&rsquo;t pick out an Earth-sized planet awash in starlight.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Watch how coronagraphs work in this animation:</em></p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Search-for-Alien-Earths-How\"}}</p><p>With Starshade, however, the starlight never even reaches the telescope. All you need is a relatively simple and small telescope, which is cheaper and easier to build. Alternatively, Starshade may not even need its own telescope, and instead rely on WFIRST.</p><p>In the meantime, the hunt for Earth&rsquo;s twin is heating up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of great science to be had by looking at planets of all size scales, but ultimately, most of us really want to find an Earth-like planet,&rdquo; says Kasdin. If that happens, calls will surely grow for answers about whether it is inhabited &ndash; the Starshade and projects like it may turn out to be our best chance.</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a>&nbsp;<em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"<p>This is part of a series called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, about the most amazing and sometimes little known technological breakthroughs, and the innovative minds behind them.</p>","CalloutPosition":"bottom","CalloutSubtitle":"Be inspired by great minds and ideas","CalloutTitle":"The Genius Behind","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-11-16T00:56:46Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"To find aliens, we need to build a giant space parasol","HeadlineShort":"Are aliens hiding behind starlight?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Could the light from stars be hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life?

But Brewster Kahle knows otherwise. &ldquo;Digital is not as immaterial as most people think,&rdquo; he says. And he&rsquo;s in a good position to comment. Kahle is the founder of the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>, an online repository of digital information. From scanned magazine articles to books, video, audio and websites &ndash; the data amassed is now over <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/What-does-a-petabyte-look-like\">20 petabytes</a> &ndash; 20 million gigabytes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all stored on physical media like hard drives or magnetic tape reels, and the Internet Archive has warehouses full of them in a number of locations worldwide. But the space they take up is not the only problem. Hard drives don&rsquo;t last that long. The materials and, in some cases, electronic components in these formats eventually decay or stop working. And discs are sometimes blighted by &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/08/18/340716269/how-long-do-cds-last-it-depends-but-definitely-not-forever\">CD rot</a>&rdquo;. The most conservative estimates suggest such media might <a href=\"https://www.storagecraft.com/blog/data-storage-lifespan/\">only be reliable for 2-5 years</a> before they risk losing data.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p039d1dl\"}}</p><blockquote><p> Given that so much of our culture is now predominantly digital, then, will it last through the centuries? </p></blockquote><p>Given that so much of our culture is now predominantly digital, then, how will it last through the centuries? How will all the information about our institutions, societies, culture and scientific discoveries be preserved for the long term? We&rsquo;re producing so much data these days that we can&rsquo;t possibly print it all out. What will future archaeologists actually turn to, if they want to study how we lived?</p><p>As BBC Future discovered recently in our series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, one possibility is that archaeologists will read our data&nbsp; &ndash; like the text of a book &ndash; from DNA, deliberately encapsulated it in &ldquo;synthetic fossils&rdquo;. In the future, it will likely only get cheaper and easier to read the code that defines all known organisms. Robert Grass, at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, and his collaborator Reinhard Heckel have developed one <a href=\"https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/02/data-storage-for-eternity.html\">method of encoding the data</a> as DNA, as the video below shows:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p038tm5z\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>So how does it work? After all, DNA itself doesn&rsquo;t keep very well. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to go into the environment, dump it underground or have it lying around somewhere for some time, DNA is not very stable. It decays in half a year or so &ndash; or even less just in ambient conditions,&rdquo; explains Grass. &ldquo;And so we were looking for a way to stabilise DNA.&rdquo;</p><p>The solution? Synthetic fossils. Grass and his colleagues knew that they needed to find a suitably inert material &ndash; something which wasn&rsquo;t reactive and wasn&rsquo;t easily damaged. In the natural world, DNA is best preserved in bone at very low temperatures. That&rsquo;s why researchers were recently able to read DNA found in bones from a <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-07/bs-sdt070213.php\">700,000-year-old horse</a>, for example. But while calcium phosphate in bones has a good chemical structure for encapsulating DNA, it has one major disadvantage &ndash; it dissolves in water.</p><blockquote><p> Eventually, the team settled on an everyday material we would all recognise: glass </p></blockquote><p>Eventually, the ETH team settled on an everyday material we would all recognise: glass (silica). &ldquo;We chemists love glass. Everything is always done in glassware &ndash; we use it for all of our reactions because of that property, it&rsquo;s extremely resilient,&rdquo; says Grass.</p><p>While a glass pane or bottle seems fragile, the glass used by ETH is extremely sturdy because it&rsquo;s incredibly small &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s basically powder. Each particle containing a lump of DNA is only around 150 nanometres wide. Freezing them, hitting them or exerting huge mechanical pressure on them would have no effect.</p><p>They can even withstand extraordinarily high temperatures but with one caveat &ndash; the DNA inside can&rsquo;t. Grass says it will be destroyed above 200C so while the particles themselves might survive a fire in a library of the future, the actual data wouldn&rsquo;t. The best temperature, in fact, for storing the synthetic fossils would be something like -18C to prevent degradation over time.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p039d1bf\"}}</p><p>Reading DNA is easy enough, though getting the DNA out of those silica particles requires a special technique using a carefully prepared fluoride solution. For this reason, Grass points out that instructions would have to be left with the archive somehow so that they would be accessible to civilisations or researchers of the far future. &ldquo;Think of a stone on which you engrave the instructions,&rdquo; he suggests as an example.</p><blockquote><p> The Rosetta Disk could be read with an optical microscope </p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the sort of problem that others have attempted to tackle in a variety of ways. Kahle gives the example of the <a href=\"http://rosettaproject.org/disk/concept/\">Rosetta Disk</a> &ndash; it&rsquo;s an archive of 1,500 human languages. There is an engraved explanation and the text of the whole archive is etched in a spiral, the beginning of which is clearly legible with the naked eye. The spiral gets smaller and smaller, but the whole thing could be read with an optical microscope.</p><p>Objects like the Rosetta Disk announce by their very form and inscription that there is something of interest and value there. Signalling this would be harder with microscopic powder and that&rsquo;s something that Grass and his colleagues are still working on. In principle, though, their approach could be used to reliably store key information for many thousands if not more than a million years.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p039d17s\"}}</p><p>One downside is that writing DNA, unlike reading it, is currently quite expensive. &ldquo;You have to choose what you store and you have to choose [why it is] important,&rdquo; comments Grass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very, very difficult choice.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the fact that, often, what mankind chooses to preserve is not always what is most revealing &ndash; or interesting about us. Our rubbish has, throughout history, been a goldmine for archaeologists trying to <a href=\"http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html\">understand how people in bygone eras really lived</a>. But whether waste survives millennia or not is essentially a matter of chance.</p><p>Civilisations always turn to dust eventually. Maybe our dust will tell a story.

Could the same thing happen to our crops and other foodstuffs too?</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that farmers in many parts of the world are going to find things harder in the coming decades. Last week, BBC Future explored one scientist&rsquo;s efforts to help crops cope with the increased likelihood of droughts. By using the genes from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151220-could-resurrection-plants-be-the-future-of-food\">&ldquo;resurrection plants&rdquo;</a>, Jill Farrant of the University of Cape Town is exploring whether she can design crops to survive for much longer periods without water.</p><p>Watch the video below to see how resurrection plants can come back from the dead, after months or even years:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p03chg6k\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>But if we can&rsquo;t find ways to protect other foods, will they survive climate change? Fortunately, there is some good news on this front. Despite <a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/photos/6-foods-are-going-extinct-because-climate-change/fish\">alarmist headlines</a> about &ldquo;foods that are going extinct,&rdquo; there is no evidence that major food types like beans, chocolate, wine, corn or wheat will cease to exist.</p><p>&ldquo;A crop itself, no, it won't go extinct,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://ccafs.cgiar.org/about/who-we-are/our-staff/researchers/theme-leader/andrew-jarvis#.VnmxCxqDGko\">Andrew Jarvis</a>, a flagship leader on the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. &ldquo;Somewhere in the world, it will grow.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Foods are unlikely to disappear under climate change, but that&rsquo;s not the whole story </p></blockquote><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s all good news for future food. We will probably have to change where we grow certain crops, as some regions get too hot. The downside, obviously, is that local farmers will suffer under this scenario. And some people may struggle to get the same access to certain foods. &ldquo;Even if overall food production may be unaffected, food security can still be impacted,&rdquo; says Margaret Walsh, an ecologist at the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Climate Change Program Office. In other words, even if a certain food is still grown on some corner of the Earth, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone will continue to have the same degree of access as today.</p><p>Overall, the yields of many foods, from staples to life-enhancing extras such as coffee and chocolate, will likely be impacted by climate change too. How those diminishments will be felt will depend on the degree of warming and the crop in question, but in general, &ldquo;anything over about 30C is very bad for crops,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/wolfram-schlenker\">Wolfram Schlenker</a>, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. For example, statistical studies that he and a colleague built of corn and soybean production in the US show a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.full\">steep decline</a> after crossing the 30C temperature threshold.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p46\"}}</p><p>In the US &ndash; the world&rsquo;s largest producer of corn and soybeans &ndash; farms can move north to some degree, Schlenker says. But eventually, yields will likely suffer because the soil north of Iowa declines in quality &ndash; a legacy of glacial expansion. Other studies, including of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n3/full/nclimate1356.html\">wheat in India</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n1/full/nclimate1043.html\">maize in Africa</a>, also found that there is a threshold above which yields sharply decline: crops can adapt and move, but only to a point. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s common to all studies is the finding that extreme heat is detrimental to crop growth, although exact cutoffs vary by crop,&rdquo; Schlenker says. &ldquo;If predictions for the end of the century are true, though, I think a lot of agricultural areas in the US will see significant hits.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> 80% of coffee-growing zones in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Under current conditions, about 4% of the world&rsquo;s croplands experience drought in any given year, but by the end of the century <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00363.1\">those conditions are projected</a> to jump to about 18% per year. <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/effects_2012/effects_agriculture.htm\">Some studies</a> indicate that horticulture crops &ndash; generally, everything besides staples &ndash; may be impacted most severely, largely because they tend to be constrained to a smaller geographic area. Jarvis and his colleagues found that <a href=\"http://www.ciatnews.cgiar.org/2015/10/27/climate-change-scientists-pinpoint-the-worlds-most-vulnerable-coffee-zones/\">80% of coffee-growing zones</a> in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050, for example, while climate change will likely have &ldquo;profound impacts&rdquo; on <a href=\"http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/?appid=eb683a0093974045b6d7c1b8fa7750fd\">cocoa production in West Africa</a>. &ldquo;High quality chocolate will be less available in the future, and if you want it, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a lot more for it,&rdquo; Jarvis says. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p65\"}}</p><p>This means that, for those who can afford it, some foods will simply cost them more in the future. But for poorer people, those same price jumps will likely cause certain foods to go extinct from their diets. &ldquo;The more you reduce, the shorter the supply, and the higher the price will jump,&rdquo; Schlenker says.</p><blockquote><p> High quality chocolate will be less available in the future, and if you want it, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a lot more for it </p></blockquote><p>Another potential climate change-induced hitch is our dependence on commodity crops &ndash; wheat, soybeans, maize and rice &ndash; which currently provide humanity with 75% of its calories, either directly or indirectly through the animals we raise on those crops. Jarvis and his colleagues also found that, over the past five decades, the world has seen <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/11/4001\">an increasing standardisation of diets</a>; the foods we eat globally today are 36% more similar than they were in 1961. While this can be good news for the world&rsquo;s poorest people who now consume more calories, protein and fat than in the past, homogeneity and over-dependence on a handful of staples leaves us vulnerable to threats such as drought, disease and pests &ndash; all of which are predicted to worsen in many parts of the world as a result of climate change.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3p9w\"}}</p><p>There are ways we could soften the coming blow to the global food supply, however. Like Farrant&rsquo;s work with resurrection crops (see video at the top of this story), a number of companies, organisations and researchers, including the <a href=\"http://dtma.cimmyt.org/index.php/component/content/article/113-news-release/154-climate-ready-maize-gets-a-boost-phase-iii-of-the-drought-tolerant-maize-in-africa-project-to-reach-more-farmers\">Gates Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/droughtgard-hybrids.aspx\">Monsanto</a>, are aiming to create drought- and temperature-resistant crops through genetic engineering and conventional breeding. For now, the jury is still out as to how successful those endeavours will be. &ldquo;The people at Monsanto who I&rsquo;ve talked to are much more optimistic that they&rsquo;ll be able to engineer heat-tolerant crops,&rdquo; Schlenker says. &ldquo;On the other hand, scientists at the USDA who I&rsquo;ve spoken with are much more cautious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Genetic engineering is one solution that we should keep developing, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a panacea that will solve everything,&rdquo; Jarvis adds. &ldquo;The evidence gathered over the last 10 years is that it hasn&rsquo;t totally revolutionised agriculture.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03d3pfx\"}}</p><p>Until genetic engineering comes to fruition, other strategies might also help in some places, including applying more fertiliser, implementing better irrigation, using machinery that gets crops out of the field faster or installing storage facilities to stave off spoilage. &ldquo;Many places could benefit a great deal just by using technologies that already exist,&rdquo; Walsh says. &ldquo;General agronomic management can go a long way toward mitigating changes.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, diversifying our diet away from heat-sensitive wheat, corn, rice and other crops could also help. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen profound changes in the last decades in what we eat largely as a result of international trade, and I think that trend toward more diversification will continue,&rdquo; Jarvis says. &ldquo;Depending on a greater number of plant species creates a more resilient, less risky food system &ndash; and one that provides a broader range of nutritional requirements.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>&nbsp;<em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"<p>This is part of a series called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, about amazing and sometimes little-known technological breakthroughs, and the innovative minds behind them.</p>","CalloutPosition":"bottom","CalloutSubtitle":"Be inspired by great minds and ideas","CalloutTitle":"The Genius Behind","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"The most amazing and sometimes little known technological and scientific breakthroughs of modern times, and the innovative minds behind them.","Name":"The Genius Behind","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"The Genius Behind","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:59:15.227753Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"42172679-9366-448f-a550-91ba1e4b9970","Id":"wwfuture/column/the-genius-behind","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:59:15.227753Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/the-genius-behind"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:59:15.227753Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"42172679-9366-448f-a550-91ba1e4b9970","Id":"wwfuture/column/the-genius-behind","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:59:15.227753Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/the-genius-behind"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/the-genius-behind","_id":"57ea85a977ca44e7511c8e96"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-12-28T08:12:46.431Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Here’s how climate change will affect what you eat","HeadlineShort":"Will climate change make foods extinct?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Could some foods go extinct, or is the threat exaggerated?

But Brewster Kahle knows otherwise. &ldquo;Digital is not as immaterial as most people think,&rdquo; he says. And he&rsquo;s in a good position to comment. Kahle is the founder of the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>, an online repository of digital information. From scanned magazine articles to books, video, audio and websites &ndash; the data amassed is now over <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/What-does-a-petabyte-look-like\">20 petabytes</a> &ndash; 20 million gigabytes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all stored on physical media like hard drives or magnetic tape reels, and the Internet Archive has warehouses full of them in a number of locations worldwide. But the space they take up is not the only problem. Hard drives don&rsquo;t last that long. The materials and, in some cases, electronic components in these formats eventually decay or stop working. And discs are sometimes blighted by &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/08/18/340716269/how-long-do-cds-last-it-depends-but-definitely-not-forever\">CD rot</a>&rdquo;.

How will all the information about our institutions, societies, culture and scientific discoveries be preserved for the long term? We&rsquo;re producing so much data these days that we can&rsquo;t possibly print it all out. What will future archaeologists actually turn to, if they want to study how we lived?</p><p>As BBC Future discovered recently in our series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, one possibility is that archaeologists will read our data&nbsp; &ndash; like the text of a book &ndash; from DNA, deliberately encapsulated it in &ldquo;synthetic fossils&rdquo;. In the future, it will likely only get cheaper and easier to read the code that defines all known organisms. Robert Grass, at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, and his collaborator Reinhard Heckel have developed one <a href=\"https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/02/data-storage-for-eternity.html\">method of encoding the data</a> as DNA, as the video below shows:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p038tm5z\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>So how does it work? After all, DNA itself doesn&rsquo;t keep very well. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to go into the environment, dump it underground or have it lying around somewhere for some time, DNA is not very stable. It decays in half a year or so &ndash; or even less just in ambient conditions,&rdquo; explains Grass. &ldquo;And so we were looking for a way to stabilise DNA.&rdquo;</p><p>The solution? Synthetic fossils. Grass and his colleagues knew that they needed to find a suitably inert material &ndash; something which wasn&rsquo;t reactive and wasn&rsquo;t easily damaged. In the natural world, DNA is best preserved in bone at very low temperatures. That&rsquo;s why researchers were recently able to read DNA found in bones from a <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-07/bs-sdt070213.php\">700,000-year-old horse</a>, for example. But while calcium phosphate in bones has a good chemical structure for encapsulating DNA, it has one major disadvantage &ndash; it dissolves in water.</p><blockquote><p> Eventually, the team settled on an everyday material we would all recognise: glass </p></blockquote><p>Eventually, the ETH team settled on an everyday material we would all recognise: glass (silica). &ldquo;We chemists love glass. Everything is always done in glassware &ndash; we use it for all of our reactions because of that property, it&rsquo;s extremely resilient,&rdquo; says Grass.</p><p>While a glass pane or bottle seems fragile, the glass used by ETH is extremely sturdy because it&rsquo;s incredibly small &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s basically powder. Each particle containing a lump of DNA is only around 150 nanometres wide. Freezing them, hitting them or exerting huge mechanical pressure on them would have no effect.</p><p>They can even withstand extraordinarily high temperatures but with one caveat &ndash; the DNA inside can&rsquo;t. Grass says it will be destroyed above 200C so while the particles themselves might survive a fire in a library of the future, the actual data wouldn&rsquo;t. The best temperature, in fact, for storing the synthetic fossils would be something like -18C to prevent degradation over time.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p039d1bf\"}}</p><p>Reading DNA is easy enough, though getting the DNA out of those silica particles requires a special technique using a carefully prepared fluoride solution. For this reason, Grass points out that instructions would have to be left with the archive somehow so that they would be accessible to civilisations or researchers of the far future. &ldquo;Think of a stone on which you engrave the instructions,&rdquo; he suggests as an example.</p><blockquote><p> The Rosetta Disk could be read with an optical microscope </p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the sort of problem that others have attempted to tackle in a variety of ways. Kahle gives the example of the <a href=\"http://rosettaproject.org/disk/concept/\">Rosetta Disk</a> &ndash; it&rsquo;s an archive of 1,500 human languages. There is an engraved explanation and the text of the whole archive is etched in a spiral, the beginning of which is clearly legible with the naked eye. The spiral gets smaller and smaller, but the whole thing could be read with an optical microscope.</p><p>Objects like the Rosetta Disk announce by their very form and inscription that there is something of interest and value there. Signalling this would be harder with microscopic powder and that&rsquo;s something that Grass and his colleagues are still working on. In principle, though, their approach could be used to reliably store key information for many thousands if not more than a million years.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p039d17s\"}}</p><p>One downside is that writing DNA, unlike reading it, is currently quite expensive. &ldquo;You have to choose what you store and you have to choose [why it is] important,&rdquo; comments Grass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very, very difficult choice.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the fact that, often, what mankind chooses to preserve is not always what is most revealing &ndash; or interesting about us. Our rubbish has, throughout history, been a goldmine for archaeologists trying to <a href=\"http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html\">understand how people in bygone eras really lived</a>. But whether waste survives millennia or not is essentially a matter of chance.</p><p>Civilisations always turn to dust eventually. Maybe our dust will tell a story.

Unlike blood, earwax is a fatty substance, which means certain molecules may concentrate there and be easier to detect than in more watery fluids. &ldquo;If you have a certain group of metabolites that like to dissolve in lipids (fats), we may be able to look at them in earwax,&rdquo; Preti says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03bv1pm\"}}</p><blockquote><p> The earwax of people of East Asian descent smells different to that of European, African or American descent </p></blockquote><p>For example, maple syrup urine disorder, a genetic condition in which people can&rsquo;t break down certain parts of proteins, can be diagnosed by sniffing earwax: &ldquo;It smells of maple syrup,&rdquo; says Preti. He recently published research revealing that the earwax of people of East Asian descent smells different to that of European, African or American descent, as does their body odour. &ldquo;We already have an indication that there is some disease-related information in earwax; there&rsquo;s also information about where you&rsquo;ve been and what you&rsquo;ve eaten.&rdquo; Whether earwax will turn out to be more useful than blood and other body fluids for diagnosing certain conditions remains to be seen, but &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know unless we investigate it,&rdquo; Preti points out.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s sweat. For decades it has been used to screen newborns for cystic fibrosis, which alters the balance of sodium and chloride in their sweat. Now, <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/sweat-sensors-will-change-how-wearables-track-your-health\">wearable patches are being developed</a> that could alert athletes to changes in the balance of electrolytes that might signal that they&rsquo;re about to &ldquo;crash&rdquo; because of dehydration or physical exertion. One advantage of monitoring sweat is that it could be done passively &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to stick yourself with a needle, or even mess about with swabs - an electronic sweat-sensor could be worn under clothing that transmits information wirelessly, without you even having to think about it. &nbsp;</p><p>But there may also be limitations. &ldquo;Sweat contains marker molecules, but they are very, very variable, which will probably preclude their direct clinical use,&rdquo; cautions Jeremy Nicholson, chair in biological chemistry at Imperial College London. Its composition is also influenced by the activity of microbes living on our skin. Blood, on the other hand, tends to provide a more accurate picture of what&rsquo;s happening inside the body, as it infiltrates every tissue, and the body keeps its basic composition in strict check.</p><p>Even within a drop of blood, there&rsquo;s still a great deal more information that might be gleaned than is currently possible. For instance, Manfred Kayser at Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands is currently developing new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19566022\">DNA tests that might enable a person&rsquo;s age, physical appearance, and geographic origin</a>, to be predicted from a blood sample, which could help police identify criminal suspects or badly decomposed bodies. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03bv1mj\"}}</p><p>Some of the greatest excitement surrounds the potential predictive power of the micro-organisms living within and upon us. &ldquo;We think that at least a third of the metabolites in our blood are being produced by our microbes,&rdquo; says Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College London and author of The Diet Myth. And it&rsquo;s becoming apparent that they are influencing our health in hitherto unimaginable ways. For instance, the mood-altering chemical serotonin isn&rsquo;t only produced by your brain cells; it turns out that certain gut bacteria produce it too, and they may therefore play a role in depression.</p><blockquote><p> I&rsquo;d be able to tell much more about you from your poo than your DNA &ndash; Tim Spector, researcher </p></blockquote><p>The best place to look for changes in your bacterial flora though, is poo. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you gave me your poo sample and your DNA sample, I&rsquo;d be able to tell much more about you from your poo than your DNA,&rdquo; says Spector. This is because although the genes of any two people are approximately 99.9% similar, we only have 10-20% of our microbes in common.&nbsp; And recent research suggests the type of microbes in our guts &ndash; and therefore our poo &ndash; are influenced by what we eat, and where we&rsquo;ve been living. &ldquo;We can identify the differences between Europeans, Africans and South Americans, and we have some early data from twins showing differences between those who live in Scotland and those that live in England,&rdquo; Spector says.</p><p>Not only could analysing our poo for microbes and the chemicals they produce help tease apart complex diseases like depression and obesity and diabetes, it could also provide an early warning that an elderly person is becoming dangerously frail and needs additional support. &ldquo;As elderly people go downhill, they have a marked rise in certain gut microbes, or a lack of others,&rdquo; says Spector.</p><p>As these new sources of information mature, and the cost of analysis decreases, more self-testing kits are inevitable. Some believe this will democratise healthcare, reducing the need for people to travel, and enabling them to monitor and take greater responsibility for their own health. But it could also result in unnecessary worry and false leads. &ldquo;We can give people tests for various things, but the interpretation of those tests will still require the guidance of a health professional,&rdquo; Carpenter points out. Issues of privacy may also come to the fore. For now at least, few of us pay much regard to what happens to our secretions and emanations once they leave our bodies.</p><p>Yet for better or worse, soon a small sample of your blood, sweat, and even your earwax will be all that&rsquo;s necessary to reveal a great deal about your behaviour, health and more.</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em><strong>LinkedIn</strong></em></a> <em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-12-14T00:12:52Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The future of medicine is testing our body fluids at home","HeadlineShort":"What your body fluids say about you","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"From earwax to faeces, your secretions have secrets.

Over the last few years, astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System, suggesting that the galaxy is teeming with worlds &ndash; at least as many as one planet per star, on average.</p><p>The existence of so many planets raises the odds that at least one of them has life &ndash; and it&rsquo;s possible there may even be an Earth &ldquo;twin&rdquo; &ndash; making alien-hunting a bona fide scientific endeavour. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re now ready to make the transition from &lsquo;are there planets?&rsquo; to &lsquo;is there life on these planets?&rsquo;&rdquo; says Nick Siegler, the chief technologist of Nasa&rsquo;s Exoplanet Exploration Program. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a huge shift in how Nasa&rsquo;s thinking about the search for life and what&rsquo;s next in the world of planetary science.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s harder than it seems to spot life from millions of miles away, especially if it&rsquo;s not intelligent </p></blockquote><p>The trouble is, it&rsquo;s harder than it seems to spot life from millions of miles away, especially if it&rsquo;s not intelligent. Last week in our series &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>&rdquo;, we told the story of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151108-if-alien-life-exists-on-exoplanets-how-would-we-know\">Sara Seager, a scientist looking for signs of life on second Earths</a>, who believes that the key is to scrutinise the atmospheres of these alien worlds. Find out why in the film below:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p037bfm3\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>One of the technologies that could help researchers like Seager achieve their goal is a seemingly crazy flower-shaped contraption called Starshade. It&rsquo;s a sort of giant space parasol designed to block light from a star, allowing a telescope to avoid the star's glare and peer into the planets in orbit &ndash; and, possibly, reveal signs of alien life.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384md6\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;If we want to find a true Earth twin in the near future &ndash; like in the next decade or two &ndash; then yes, we definitely need to do the Starshade,&rdquo; says Seager, who is based at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p><p>That&rsquo;s because a Sun-like star is 10 billion times brighter than an Earth-sized planet. The only hope astronomers have for glimpsing any hint of life &ndash; likely some form of microorganism &ndash; would be to somehow block the light from such a star, allowing a telescope to directly observe the planet itself. It&rsquo;s a strategy radically different from the main way astronomers have discovered and studied planets so far.<strong> <br /></strong></p><p>Because planets are so distant, small, and faint, astronomers have mostly probed them indirectly &ndash; for example by detecting dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of its star or by measuring how the star wobbles when a planet&rsquo;s gravity tugs on it. But alien-hunting demands a new tactic.</p><p>Scientists hope to identify the gases in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, and detect chemicals that suggest the presence of life &ndash; chemicals like oxygen, which comprises 20% of Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384mbb\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Without life &ndash; plants or photosynthetic bacteria &ndash; we would have virtually no oxygen,&rdquo; Seager says. Which is why oxygen is one of the most promising so-called biosignatures. But life on Earth produces all kinds of gases, and alien life could be even more diverse. The challenge is in determining whether these chemicals are biological in origin. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Although no-one&rsquo;s found any signs of life yet, astronomers have already sniffed out some atmospheres </p></blockquote><p>Although no-one&rsquo;s found any signs of life yet, astronomers have already sniffed out some atmospheres. When a planet passes in front of its star, the starlight penetrates the gaseous layer enveloping the planet. The molecules in the atmosphere absorb specific wavelengths of light, depending on what the chemical is. By measuring which wavelengths are absorbed, astronomers can identify the gases.</p><p>Bigger telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, slated for launch in 2018, will be able to use this transit technique to resolve atmospheric chemistry in greater detail. It could even conceivably detect biosignatures. &ldquo;It could get lucky,&rdquo; Siegler says. But this method is only good for planetary systems around small stars called M dwarfs &ndash; not around Sun-like stars.</p><p>Which is why astronomers like Seager want to make Starshade a reality. The video below shows how it might work in space, as well as a timelapse of the instrument unfurling on Earth.</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p0384lcm\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>The Starshade is launched with a telescope, and when it reaches its position in deep space, it will unfurl and expand to a diameter as wide as 34m (112ft). The petals, which will likely be razor-sharp, remove the effects of diffraction, in which light waves bend around the edge of the shade and produce unwanted glare. The shade and telescope will then separate by as much as 50,000 kilometres (31,250 miles) &ndash; almost four times the diameter of Earth.</p><p>Suffice to say, this isn't easy. But researchers have shown the idea to work with experiments in the desert, using a lamp, a model Starshade, and a camera. Jeremy Kasdin of Princeton University, one of the leaders of the Starshade project, is conducting lab tests with a miniature model to scale &ndash; the setup stretches for 78m (257ft), with a Starshade about five centimetres wide.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384lt0\"}}</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384lvt\"}}</p><p>If the project gets enough funding and all goes well, Nasa could launch Starshade as early as 2026. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see right now any technical impediments to complete a Starshade and flying it in the 2020s,&rdquo; Kasdin says.</p><p>But Starshade isn&rsquo;t the only way to block starlight. Its launch could coincide with WFIRST, a next-generation space telescope that&rsquo;s planned to be fitted with an instrument called a coronagraph, which blocks starlight from inside the telescope. &ldquo;We want multiple approaches in case one doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Siegler says.</p><p>A coronagraph is a tried-and-tested technology &ndash; first developed in the 1930s to study the outer layers of the sun called the corona &ndash; and could also find Earth&rsquo;s twin. But, Siegler says, the technology isn&rsquo;t there yet.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0384m66\"}}</p><p>Coronagraphs are complex and fragile instruments, which make them susceptible to the Sun&rsquo;s heat and vibrations from things like the telescope&rsquo;s reaction wheels used to orient the spacecraft. Anything that can knock the telescope off-kilter means stray starlight gets into the camera, ruining the observations. Deformable mirrors can cancel out some distortions, but the current systems can&rsquo;t pick out an Earth-sized planet awash in starlight.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Watch how coronagraphs work in this animation:</em></p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Search-for-Alien-Earths-How\"}}</p><p>With Starshade, however, the starlight never even reaches the telescope. All you need is a relatively simple and small telescope, which is cheaper and easier to build. Alternatively, Starshade may not even need its own telescope, and instead rely on WFIRST.</p><p>In the meantime, the hunt for Earth&rsquo;s twin is heating up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of great science to be had by looking at planets of all size scales, but ultimately, most of us really want to find an Earth-like planet,&rdquo; says Kasdin. If that happens, calls will surely grow for answers about whether it is inhabited &ndash; the Starshade and projects like it may turn out to be our best chance.</p><p><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a>&nbsp;<em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"<p>This is part of a series called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/the-genius-behind\">The Genius Behind</a>, about the most amazing and sometimes little known technological breakthroughs, and the innovative minds behind them.</p>","CalloutPosition":"bottom","CalloutSubtitle":"Be inspired by great minds and ideas","CalloutTitle":"The Genius Behind","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-11-16T00:56:46Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"To find aliens, we need to build a giant space parasol","HeadlineShort":"Are aliens hiding behind starlight?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Could the light from stars be hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life?

It&rsquo;s not secret or underground, but the &pound;212m building is home to a number of futuristic projects worthy of their own Hollywood movie.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>In her own small corner of this research utopia, Madeleine&rsquo;s team is at work on a task so absurd it seems more wizardly than scientific: they&rsquo;re transforming human skin into brains.</p><p>&ldquo;The brains develop in the same way you would see in an embryo,&rdquo; says Madeleine. This may be true, but their surroundings are rather different. In place of a womb, the disembodied brains are raised in giant incubators. Without a blood supply they are fed with a nutrient-rich fluid which is refreshed every few days. And, of course, they don&rsquo;t have an immune system: everything &ndash; <em>everything</em> &ndash; which comes into contact with them must be disinfected first with alcohol.</p><blockquote><p> Just like regular brains, each is composed of specific regions </p></blockquote><p>When she opens the incubator door &ndash; well, I have to admit they don&rsquo;t look as impressive as I&rsquo;d imagined: insipid, watery blobs floating in a pool of pale pink liquid. They look more like bits of waterlogged popcorn than powerhouses of intellectual ability.</p><p>But their looks are deceiving. In fact these &ldquo;cerebral organoids&rdquo;, as they have been christened, are strikingly similar to the brains of ordinary people. Just like any other brain, the organoids are divided into grey matter &ndash; which is made of neurons &ndash; and white matter, a fatty tissue composed of their spindly &lsquo;tails&rsquo;.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

There&rsquo;s the wrinkled cortex (thought to be the seat of language and conscious thought) the hippocampus (the centre of emotion and memory), the ancient, muscle-coordinating cerebellum, and many, many others. In all, they are equivalent to the brains of nine-week-old foetuses.</p><p>So how are they made?</p><blockquote><p> With a few simple ingredients &ndash; and an unquenchable enthusiasm for drenching things in alcohol &ndash; you too could have a miniature brain in a matter of months </p></blockquote><p>In fact, making a brain isn&rsquo;t as difficult as you might expect. With a few simple ingredients &ndash; and an unquenchable enthusiasm for drenching things in alcohol &ndash; you too could have a miniature brain in a matter of months.</p><p>First off, you&rsquo;ll need some cells. Lancaster&rsquo;s team took theirs from samples of donated skin but, somewhat disconcertingly, to make this masterpiece of human evolution you could start with any cell type &ndash; be it nose, liver, or toenail.</p><p>Only stem cells are able to develop into all the body&rsquo;s tissues, so next you&rsquo;ll need to turn your cells into some of those. For this, the team used a kind of cellular youth serum, a protein cocktail which can rewind the clock and turn any cell back into an embryonic-like state.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>After about a week of growth, you should end up with a sheet of cells which can be scraped off the petri dish and moulded into a ball.</p><p>Lancaster takes out what looks like an empty dish of pink liquid. &ldquo;You can see them in there &ndash; they are tiny at this point,&rdquo; she says. Sure enough, each well contains a white dot about the size of a comma. &ldquo;They kind of want to become an embryo,&rdquo; she says.

Among them will be brain cells.</p><p>To begin with, the researchers are doting parents, keeping their embryos fed and encouraging them to continue to grow. But they aren&rsquo;t spoilt for long. Next the balls of cells are transferred to a new dish, this time with very little food. As the cells begin to starve, most of them will die off, leaving only the brain cells behind. &ldquo;They are really robust &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows why,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> The brains are constantly buzzing with electrical activity as neurons zap off signals to one another </p></blockquote><p>Finally, the developing brains are enveloped in a blanket of jelly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the opposite of normal jelly &ndash; it starts off as a liquid which you pour on and it jellifies as it warms up in the incubator,&rdquo; she says. The jelly mimics the tissue a brain would normally be surrounded with in an embryo &ndash; like a makeshift skull &ndash; and encourages them to develop relatively normally.</p><p>Then all you have to do is sit back and wait. Three months later, the finished product is about four millimetres across and contains around two million neurons. &ldquo;A fully developed, adult mouse brain only contains four million, so you can do a lot with that number,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The brains are constantly buzzing with electrical activity as neurons zap off signals to one another &ndash; though Lancaster says this isn&rsquo;t much of an achievement on her part. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very special but it does tell us that we are making functional neurons and that they are acting like neurons,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>She compares it to the heart cells which scientists coaxed to <a href="https://youtu.be/BqzW9Jq-OVA">beat inside a petri dish</a> back in 2013; while heart cells are programmed to &ldquo;want&rdquo; to pump, neurons &ldquo;want&rdquo; to fire. &ldquo;Even if you have a neuron by itself in a dish with no other neurons, it wants to fire so badly that it will connect to itself in order to fire,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>At the moment, Lancaster&rsquo;s brains aren&rsquo;t thought to be able to think. Nobody understands how the activity of our brains gives rise to thoughts &ndash; and it&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to define what a thought actually is &ndash; but it might go something like this. Usually, when we&rsquo;re exposed to stimulation from the outside world &ndash; smells, sounds, ideas &ndash; our brains store the information by strengthening the connections between our neurons or forming new ones. The average adult will have as many as 1,000 trillion, which together give our brains an equivalent processing power to a one trillion-bit-per-second computer.</p><p>And here&rsquo;s the rub. Even with all the same components as regular brains, without a body to provide information about the world around them, the brains simply can&rsquo;t develop normally. &ldquo;The neurons are working but they aren&rsquo;t really organised relative to one another,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Lancaster gives the example of people who are born blind. &ldquo;Since they aren&rsquo;t exposed to light, the part of the brain that [these signals] would normally connect up is actually not going to form,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> The team has been taking individual genes involved in brain development and replacing them with the chimpanzee version &ndash; then using these cells to make hybrid chimp-human brains </p></blockquote><p>If you hooked lab-grown brains up to an EEG, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t see anything. The so-called &ldquo;brain waves&rdquo; which the machines can detect occur as a result of millions of neurons firing in synchrony; when combined, their electrical signals are detectable through the scalp.</p><p>&ldquo;This is kind of a good thing, I think. I&rsquo;d have some issues if I thought there was proper network formation there,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>But making conscious brains was never part of the plan. Instead, Lancaster is using hers to answer a decades-old mystery: for all our intellectual superiority, the <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics">genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees</a> is around 1.2%. That&rsquo;s only 12 times higher than the differences between individual humans (0.1%). Why?</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>To find out, the team has been taking individual genes involved in brain development and replacing them with the chimpanzee version &ndash; then using these cells to make hybrid chimp-human brains. As they develop, the role of the gene often becomes clear; the brains with the chimpanzee gene may be significantly smaller than ordinary human brains, or contain fewer neurons, for example.</p><p>In other words, the brains allow researchers to do experiments they would normally never be allowed to do (imagine the controversy if a chimpanzee gene was added to an actual human).</p><p>Eventually, Lancaster hopes to do the opposite version of the experiments with lab-grown chimpanzee brains, too. This is tricky, because they are a protected species &ndash; you can&rsquo;t just walk up to a chimpanzee and take a piece of skin &ndash; but they&rsquo;ve found an alternative, if fairly unglamorous, supply of cells. &ldquo;If an animal has a baby in a zoo, they would normally just throw away the placenta, but we can take these leftovers,&rdquo; she says.</p><blockquote><p> Several groups are working on improving the brains, introducing a blood supply so that they can grow larger </p></blockquote><p>Elsewhere, the organoids are being used to study uniquely human diseases, from autism to schizophrenia. Historically, it was difficult to study their causes in the lab because &ndash; by their very definition &ndash; no other animal can get them.</p><p>Take autism. Severely autistic children aren&rsquo;t able to speak &ndash; how can you study this disorder in a mouse if it was never able to speak in the first place?</p><p>By comparing brains grown from the skin of normal adults and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186191">autistic patients</a>, last year scientists were able to show that the disease may be caused by an imbalance of the two main types of neuron, those which initiate signals (excitatory neurons), and those which act as a brake (inhibitory neurons).</p><p>&ldquo;In a normal brain there&rsquo;s a very fine balance between those two types, so you could imagine this could have a big impact on the way the networks function,&rdquo; says Lancaster.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>The real breakthrough is that not only can the brains simulate these disorders, but they allow scientists to go back in time and work out why the autistic brains are different. &ldquo;You can watch them over time and find out at what point during their development they start to look different. Well of course you can&rsquo;t normally do that,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The man-made brains are already transforming our understanding of the brain, its disorders and what makes humans special. Though they were only invented in 2013, a quick Google search of &ldquo;cerebral organoids&rdquo; turns up 2,820 scientific papers already.</p><p>So what does the future hold? Several groups are working on improving the brains, introducing a blood supply so that they can grow larger; at the moment, the 4mm brains are entirely reliant on Oxygen and nutrients diffusing in from the surrounding liquid.</p><p>For many scientists, the ultimate goal is for the brains to function like normal brains &ndash; forming networks which can be stained, sliced up and studied like the brains of lab mice. But for now, the organoids are as inert as the bits of popcorn they resemble.</p><p><em>Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>, or follow us on</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/bbc_future"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a> <em>and </em><a href="https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href="http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/"><em>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</em></a><em>, called &ldquo;</em><em>If You Only Read 6 Things This Week</em><em>&rdquo;.
