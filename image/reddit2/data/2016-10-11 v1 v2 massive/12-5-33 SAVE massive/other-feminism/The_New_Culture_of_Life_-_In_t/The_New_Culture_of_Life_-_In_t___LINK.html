Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court\u2019s most vociferously anti-abortion justice, died in February. Then in June, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt\u2014the most sweeping abortion decision since 1992\u2014the court struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law that placed strict restrictions on abortion clinics under the guise of women\u2019s health and safety; similar laws in Alabama, Mississippi, and Wisconsin rapidly fell in the wake of the 5\u20133 vote. As the Catholic writer Michael Brendan Dougherty summed it up this summer, \u201c2016 is turning out to be the worst year for the pro-life cause in at least a generation.\u201d Normally, an election season would bring the promise of a restart: the possibility of a Republican ally in the White House, and a Supreme Court justice or three following in his wake. But Republican nominee Donald Trump called himself \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d as recently as 1999 and has been downright incoherent on the issue during the past year. Even if you believe his conversion to the anti-abortion cause, he has shown almost no grasp of its language or the ideas behind it. As evangelical writer Matthew Lee Anderson put it in July in an essay titled \u201cThere Is No Pro-Life Case for Donald Trump,\u201d Trump is \u201csomeone who in his personal life has not merely lived in, but reveled in the moral atmosphere and commitments that stand beneath our abortion culture.\u201d The video made public on Friday of Trump boasting about sexual assault was just a visceral reminder of a well-known truth: The Republican candidate\u2019s private moral code is built on what you might call anti\u2013family values. Despite recent setbacks, however, the demographic outlook for the pro-life movement looks anything but bleak. On issues from race to sexuality to drug law, Americans are used to seeing each new generation become more progressive than their parents; with abortion, it\u2019s not happening: In a 2015 Public Religion Research Institute survey, 52 percent of millennials said the label \u201cpro-life\u201d describes them somewhat or very well, a number that roughly mirrors the general population. A 2013 poll showed that 52 percent of people aged 18 to 29 favored bans on abortion after 20 weeks, compared with 48 percent overall. Pro-choice activists now worry about the \u201cintensity gap\u201d among young people: A poll commissioned by NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2010 found that 51 percent of anti-abortion voters younger than 30 considered the issue \u201cvery important,\u201d but for pro-choice voters the same age, only 26 percent said the same. With these numbers in mind, it\u2019s possible that the pro-life movement is in a moment of transition, not retreat. This impression is only reinforced by talking to the leaders of the movement\u2019s next generation, who look very little like their elders. In conversations over the past several weeks with activists and other young people who care deeply about ending abortion, I found many who are skeptical of the movement\u2019s long-held ties to the GOP and the Christian right. Instead, they are using the language of feminism, human rights, and the Black Lives Matter movement to make their case for a new culture of life. \u201cThere\u2019 a little bit of truth to the old pro-choice saying that the movement is a bunch of old conservative white men,\u201d activist Aimee Murphy told me. \u201cBut I really have seen a massive shift with the youth, to ensure that our solutions are women-centered and that we\u2019re being consistent and nonpartisan, inclusive and opening and welcoming.\u201d * * * Murphy was a pro-choice 16-year-old in California when an abusive, on-off boyfriend raped her. When the rape resulted in a pregnancy scare, Murphy\u2019s rapist wanted her to get an abortion, and threatened to kill her and himself if she didn\u2019t. A decade later, she still chokes up when she talks about that time in her life. But the threat was also clarifying. \u201cIn that moment, something clicked,\u201d she said. \u201cI could not use violence to get what I wanted in life. I realized that if I were to get an abortion, I would just be passing oppression on to a child.\u201d Now 27, Murphy is the founder of the Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Life Matters Journal, which describes itself as a \u201chuman rights organization dedicated to bringing an end to aggressive violence.\u201d The organization and its flagship publication oppose abortion as well as torture, the death penalty, and \u201cunjust war.\u201d Murphy believes that the modern conservative movement doesn\u2019t grasp what she calls the \u201cintrinsic worth\u201d of every human life, echoing Catholic theology. \u201cAnd if they do understand it,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re making a lot of exceptions.\u201d Life Matters Journal\u2019s slate of ethical and political stances is very similar to official positions of the Catholic Church. In particular, it echoes the \u201cconsistent life ethic,\u201d a concept promoted by Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin starting in the early 1980s, which began with the premise that all life is sacred. But many young pro-life activists, even if they are Catholic\u2014and many are\u2014prefer not to frame their arguments as religious. The Southern Baptist co-president of Harvard\u2019s pro-life club, Will Long, told me that talking about \u201cintrinsic human rights\u201d is a way to open up conversations about the morality of abortion with students who aren\u2019t religious. \u201cHuman rights\u201d was a phrase I heard over and over from the young activists I spoke to. The pro-choice movement has long framed access to abortion as a human right; pro-life advocates have been able to borrow that language thanks in part to technology. When Tina Whittington, now the executive vice president of Students for Life of America, got started in pro-life activism in the 1990s, she held signs depicting aborted fetuses outside abortion clinics. The premise of this notoriously confrontational approach was that to see a fetus\u2019s fingers and toes, or its tiny profile, would provoke a kind of awakening: This can\u2019t be just a \u201cclump of cells,\u201d to borrow from pro-choice rhetoric, because it looks just like a baby. Today, though, ultrasound images\u2014including incredibly precise three-dimensional sonograms\u2014are widely available and shared heavily on social media. \u201cThe millennial generation has had access to the womb,\u201d Whittington said. \u201cA lot of young people have seen those images, and realize that there\u2019s a baby, and it\u2019s a human being.\u201d On college campuses, according to Whittington, many pro-choice students acknowledge that the fetus is a form of human life\u2014even if they believe the mother deserves preference\u2014or that a fetus exists on a kind of continuum of life that still makes abortion morally acceptable within a prescribed time frame. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a nuanced discussion now,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also an increasingly nonreligious one. In her talks on college campuses, activist Kelsey Hazzard, founder of the organization Secular Pro-Life, likes to point out that millennials are both the \u201cpro-life generation\u201d and the least religious generation. The 2013 Pew survey showed that 25 percent of nonreligious Americans believe having an abortion is morally wrong; as the nonreligious population, or \u201cnones,\u201d continues to grow, the number of pro-life \u201cnones\u201d will grow, too. A 2014 Pew survey found that 18-to-29-year-olds make up a disproportionate 39 percent of anti-abortion \u201cnones.\u201d But these would-be activists had trouble finding each other without church-based institutions to coalesce around, according to Hazzard, 28, who works by day as a civil litigation attorney in Naples, Florida. She started Secular Pro-Life as a student at the University of Miami, initially just as a place for nonreligious pro-lifers to connect online. Although Christian churches served as convenient organizational bases for the first decades of activism in the post\u2013Roe v. Wade era, those spaces can be alienating to nonbelievers who might be otherwise sympathetic to the anti-abortion message. Hazzard sees the internet as an alternative infrastructure for the next generation of pro-life activists, who have different moral assumptions and different political concerns than the old-school Christian right. \u201cWe've been in the process over the last five to 10 years of a baton-passing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think as that process continues, and particularly as people drop the same-sex marriage issue\u2014please\u2014and focus on life issues, that will be the cultural shift.\u201d That shift involves a pivot to \u201chuman rights arguments\u201d as opposed to Bible-based ones, she says. Maria Oswalt, a 22-year-old senior at the University of Alabama who leads the campus\u2019 Students for Life chapter, gets frustrated when pro-life advocates vocally oppose, say, transgender bathroom bills\u2014the kind of issue that she sees as having no inherent connection to abortion and that serves only to make the movement look intolerant. Her Students for Life chapter focuses on abortion, but it also opposes the death penalty and assisted suicide; Oswalt sees these issues as naturally connected to abortion in a way that gender and sexuality are not. \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on life issues, and not try to pull these other nonrelated issues into it,\u201d she said. As Murphy and others told me, moral consistency matters a great deal to their younger compatriots in the movement, whose pro-life ethic means concern for life \u201cfrom womb to tomb.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a partisan issue, it\u2019s not a religious issue,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d * * * One stereotype of the pro-life movement is that it is dominated by men, and old men at that. Last year, when the popular conservative site Newsmax compiled a list of the Top 100 most influential pro-life advocates, only five of the Top 20 were female, and one of those was the soon-to-pass-away Phyllis Schlafly. But that\u2019s starting to change. There\u2019s Kristan Hawkins, the 31-year-old president of Students for Life of America. Lila Rose, now 28, is the founder of Live Action, a brash organization that has produced several news-making exposés of Planned Parenthood; Rose is now arguably the most famous young pro-lifer in America. (David Daleiden, the 27-year-old who filmed last year\u2019s undercover video of a Planned Parenthood executive discussing tissue donation, got his start at Live Action.) The Susan B. Anthony List, Concerned Women for America, and the National Right to Life Committee are among the other prominent groups led by women. Many of the campus leaders and other young activists I spoke with are women. Women aren\u2019t just leading the next generation of the pro-life movement\u2014many of them are doing it using the language of feminism, which would have been anathema to the old guard of pro-life activists. If you believe, as sociologist Kristin Luker suggested in her influential 1984 book Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood, that opposing abortion is really just a stealthy way of controlling women, the notion of an anti-abortion feminism will sound either absurd or morally outrageous. But the idea that pro-lifers are simply out to oppress women was always an oversimplification, and it\u2019s especially imprecise as a description of the next generation of activists. Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, who is 33 and lives in Dallas, does not fit the stereotype of a pro-life activist: She has neon pink hair, and she calls activists who use graphic posters of aborted fetuses \u201cthe turd in the Kool-Aid.\u201d She founded New Wave Feminists in 2007 because she \u201cwanted to see a change not only in the feminist movement, but in the pro-life movement.\u201d Herndon-De La Rosa wants to smash the patriarchy, but she sees it in unexpected places: in \u201cdouchebags\u201d who \u201ctreat fertility like a disease\u201d by expecting their partners to be on chemical birth control and to get an abortion if they do get pregnant, for example. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how more radical feminists don\u2019t see that,\u201d she said. Murphy likes to say that the future of the pro-life movement is feminist, and the future of the feminist movement is pro-life. \u201cI see this movement going in a direction that is a lot more women-centered,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are we doing to help women in need? What are we doing to empower women? What are we doing to promote equality among all persons?\u201d The fact that women are expected to bear the consequences of pregnancy alone, and that pregnancy often seems incompatible with success, is \u201ca grave form of injustice that we are passing on to women,\u201d she said. Students for Life of America, the largest group of campus pro-life clubs, launched an initiative in 2011 to support pregnant women on college campuses by connecting them with resources like health care and housing and by informing them of their Title IX rights. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not just about her choosing life, although of course that is our passion,\u201d executive vice president Whittington said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about seeing her finish school, because we know the No. 1 segment of our population that\u2019s at or below poverty level is single mothers.\u201d Christina Bennett, an activist in Connecticut, works full time at a \u201ccrisis pregnancy center,\u201d centers that, as Nora Caplan-Bricker put it earlier this year in Slate, \u201cexist to prevent women from getting abortions.\u201d According to Bennett, the pro-life movement needs to do a better job speaking to young black women such as herself. Like the Black Lives Matter movement, she says, the pro-life cause is fundamentally about protecting a vulnerable population. \u201cI really want to be able to reach the African American community with a message of life as a human rights issue and a civil rights issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a message that appeals to African Americans because we know what it\u2019s like to be victimized, to be looked down upon.\u201d At the same time, she questions the motives and sincerity of some pro-life activists who have appropriated the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter. (\u201cIf Black Lives Matter, Protest Planned Parenthood,\u201d read a headline on the leading pro-life news site Life News in July.) \u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s saying, \u2018I care about black babies in the womb,\u2019 and then you see Tamir Rice, you see Mike Brown, and your first response is that the black community doesn\u2019t really care because they\u2019re aborting all their babies\u2014if that\u2019s your first response, then something is missing,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cYou\u2019re not showing empathy.\u201d * * * With just about a month until Election Day, Trump has successfully dragged the old guard of anti-abortion activists to his side, however belatedly and begrudgingly. \u201cThe pro-life movement has officially joined the Trump train,\u201d the Daily Beast reported recently as the candidate launched his Pro-Life Coalition, headed by an activist who once urged Republicans primary voters to support \u201canyone but Donald Trump.\u201d Many of Trump\u2019s defenders among the religious right have stuck by him even in the wake of the leaked Access Hollywood video. In reiterating his loyalty on Monday, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson emphasized Trump\u2019s \u201cpromises to support religious liberty and the dignity of the unborn.\u201d But the movement\u2019s next generation have not been so easily co-opted. For the first few weeks of my reporting, I struggled to find a single young pro-life voter who would talk to me about supporting Trump. Over time, they trickled in: the Chicago activist who said at least Trump seems to realize he needs pro-lifers on this side, the Virginia college student who said it was worth it because Trump might tilt the Supreme Court against abortion rights. \u201cWhen you consider what pro-lifers believe abortion is, which is essentially the systematic killing of millions of children every year, that\u2019s an issue of some national importance,\u201d said Long, the co-president of Harvard Right to Life. \u201cIf Clinton gets this nomination, you know that essentially our generation is not going to fix Roe v. Wade.\u201d Even with those stakes, Long would only say he is \u201ctentatively\u201d leaning toward Trump. (He confirmed Monday that the Access Hollywood tape had not changed that.) Many of the activists and voters I spoke with feel a visceral disgust toward the Republican nominee. Many told me that abortion is important to them because they believe all human life is valuable; this idea is not one that fits with Trump\u2019s worldview. Long\u2019s co-president, Maria McLaughlin, says she abhors Trump\u2019s obsession with building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; Herndon-De La Rosa is appalled by his misogyny. Trump may have \u201cconverted\u201d to being pro-life, many activists told me, but as Hazzard puts it, \u201ctying the pro-life brand to the Trump brand is just totally incompatible and disastrous. Anyone who has supported Trump or even been silent on the matter is going to have no credibility going forward, particularly among young people.\u201d Secular Pro-Life broke from its own tradition and denounced Trump in the primaries, a condemnation it has not revoked in the general election. Does Trump\u2019s sanity-threatening candidacy create an opening for Democrats to capture the next generation of pro-life voters? It\u2019s tempting to think so: A young pro-lifer who also thinks of herself as an antiwar feminist is not an otherwise traditional Republican voter. Still, few young pro-lifers I spoke to felt comfortable voting for Hillary Clinton. They are disturbed by her support for legal late-term abortion and for repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used to pay for abortion. The Democratic platform adopted at the convention in July is more strongly in favor of abortion rights than ever. That makes the Republican Party the only quasi-reasonable place for committed pro-life voters. \u201cThere are a lot of times I wish the Democrats would give up their dogged and relentless support for abortion,\u201d Matt Yonke, the assistant communications director of the Pro-Life Action League, told me by email. \u201cI think they\u2019d be surprised how many people might switch parties if it weren\u2019t for this issue. Welfare programs, gun laws, taxes\u2014all the things conservatives are known for caring about\u2014don\u2019t matter at all to me and many serious pro-lifers I know.\u201d Some pro-life thinkers have yearned for a new \u201cparty of life\u201d that would embrace both anti-abortion policies and traditionally Democratic family policies such as increased child-tax credits and tax credits for corporations with family-friendly policies. With the recent legislative and judicial setbacks, however, many in the \u201cpro-life generation\u201d find themselves wondering whether politics are even going to be their path to victory. \u201cThe pro-life message is not about who\u2019s president or about legislation; it\u2019s about cultural change,\u201d Herndon-De La Rosa said. \u201cIf we can learn anything from the LGBTQ movement, they changed the culture and the laws followed. ... Ultimately abortion is going to be the same thing. We have to humanize the child. People have to understand this is a human being with their own bodily autonomy.\u201d That argument is, she stressed, \u201ccompletely a feminist message.\u201d Whittington looks back further in history for inspiration. She mentions Buck v. Bell, a 1927 Supreme Court case that ruled that compulsory sterilization of the \u201cunfit\u201d was constitutional; it has never been overturned, although the practice is now rightly viewed as repugnant. Whittington sees a lesson there: A movement doesn\u2019t need to change the law if it can change enough people\u2019s minds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re ever going to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our culture can move past it.\u201d","headline":"What Does the Future of the Pro-Life Movement Look Like?","datePublished":"2016-10-11T05:51:00-04:00","author":"Ruth Graham","image":{"@list":["http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/10/161004_DX_New-Pro-Life-Movement.jpg.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.jpg"]}}

<p>If you are a pro-life activist, you have several reasons to be discouraged at the moment. Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s most vociferously anti-abortion justice, died in February. Then in June, in <em>Whole Woman&rsquo;s Health v. Hellerstedt</em>&mdash;the most sweeping abortion decision since 1992&mdash;the court <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/06/28/scotus_ruling_in_whole_woman_s_health_is_just_the_beginning.html">struck down</a> parts of a 2013 Texas law that placed strict restrictions on abortion clinics under the guise of women&rsquo;s health and safety; similar laws in Alabama, Mississippi, and Wisconsin <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/06/28/scotus_ruling_in_whole_woman_s_health_is_just_the_beginning.html">rapidly fell</a> in the wake of the 5&ndash;3 vote. As the Catholic writer Michael Brendan Dougherty <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/633551/2016-already-catastrophic-year-prolife-movement">summed it up</a> this summer, &ldquo;2016 is turning out to be the worst year for the pro-life cause in at least a generation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Normally, an election season would bring the promise of a restart: the possibility of a Republican ally in the White House, and a Supreme Court justice or three following in his wake. But Republican nominee Donald Trump called himself <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-in-1999-i-am-very-pro-choice-480297539914">&ldquo;very pro-choice&rdquo;</a> as recently as 1999 and has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/">downright incoherent</a> on the issue during the past year. Even if you believe his conversion to the anti-abortion cause, he has shown almost no grasp of its language or the ideas behind it. As evangelical writer Matthew Lee Anderson put it in July in an essay titled &ldquo;<a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/no-pro-life-case-donald-trump/" target="_blank">There Is No Pro-Life Case for Donald Trump</a>,&rdquo; Trump is &ldquo;someone who in his personal life has not merely lived in, but reveled in the moral atmosphere and commitments that stand beneath our abortion culture.&rdquo; The video made public on Friday of Trump <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_brags_about_committing_criminal_sexual_assault.html" target="_blank">boasting about sexual assault</a> was just a visceral reminder of a well-known truth: The Republican candidate&rsquo;s private moral code is built on what you might call anti&ndash;family values.</p>

<p>Despite recent setbacks, however, the demographic outlook for the pro-life movement looks anything but bleak. On issues from race to sexuality to drug law, Americans are used to seeing each new generation become more progressive than their parents; with abortion, it&rsquo;s not happening: In a <a href="http://www.prri.org/research/survey-how-race-and-religion-shape-millennial-attitudes-on-sexuality-and-reproductive-health/">2015 Public Religion Research Institute survey</a>, 52 percent of millennials said the label &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; describes them somewhat or very well, a number that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191834/americans-attitudes-toward-abortion-unchanged.aspx">roughly mirrors</a> the general population. A 2013 poll showed that <a href="http://www.nationalmemo.com/poll-plurality-supports-ban-on-abortions-after-20-weeks/">52 percent</a> of people aged 18 to 29 favored bans on abortion after 20 weeks, compared with 48 percent overall. Pro-choice activists now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/exclusive-naral-president-nancy-keenan-to-step-down/2012/05/10/gIQAn85PGU_blog.html">worry</a> about the &ldquo;intensity gap&rdquo; among young people: A poll commissioned by NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2010 found that 51 percent of anti-abortion voters younger than 30 considered the issue &ldquo;very important,&rdquo; but for pro-choice voters the same age, only 26 percent said the same.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

<p>With these numbers in mind, it&rsquo;s possible that the pro-life movement is in a moment of transition, not retreat. This impression is only reinforced by talking to the leaders of the movement&rsquo;s next generation, who look very little like their elders. In conversations over the past several weeks with activists and other young people who care deeply about ending abortion, I found many who are skeptical of the movement&rsquo;s long-held ties to the GOP and the Christian right. Instead, they are using the language of feminism, human rights, and the Black Lives Matter movement to make their case for a new culture of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo; a little bit of truth to the old pro-choice saying that the movement is a bunch of old conservative white men,&rdquo; activist Aimee Murphy told me. &ldquo;But I really have seen a massive shift with the youth, to ensure that our solutions are women-centered and that we&rsquo;re being consistent and nonpartisan, inclusive and opening and welcoming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Murphy was a pro-choice 16-year-old in California when an abusive, on-off boyfriend raped her. When the rape resulted in a pregnancy scare, Murphy&rsquo;s rapist wanted her to get an abortion, and threatened to kill her and himself if she didn&rsquo;t. A decade later, she still chokes up when she talks about that time in her life. But the threat was also clarifying. &ldquo;In that moment, something clicked,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could not use violence to get what I wanted in life. I realized that if I were to get an abortion, I would just be passing oppression on to a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now 27, Murphy is the founder of the Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Life Matters Journal, which describes itself as a &ldquo;human rights organization dedicated to bringing an end to aggressive violence.&rdquo; The organization and its flagship publication oppose abortion as well as torture, the death penalty, and &ldquo;unjust war.&rdquo; Murphy believes that the modern conservative movement doesn&rsquo;t grasp what she calls the &ldquo;intrinsic worth&rdquo; of every human life, echoing Catholic theology. &ldquo;And if they do understand it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re making a lot of exceptions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Life Matters Journal&rsquo;s slate of ethical and political stances is very similar to official positions of the Catholic Church. In particular, it echoes the &ldquo;consistent life ethic,&rdquo; a concept promoted by Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin starting in the early 1980s, which began with the premise that all life is sacred. But many young pro-life activists, even if they are Catholic&mdash;and many are&mdash;prefer not to frame their arguments as religious. The Southern Baptist co-president of Harvard&rsquo;s pro-life club, Will Long, told me that talking about &ldquo;intrinsic human rights&rdquo; is a way to open up conversations about the morality of abortion with students who aren&rsquo;t religious. &ldquo;Human rights&rdquo; was a phrase I heard over and over from the young activists I spoke to.</p>

<div class="text parbase text-10 section">

<p>The pro-choice movement has long framed access to abortion as a human right; pro-life advocates have been able to borrow that language thanks in part to technology. When Tina Whittington, now the executive vice president of Students for Life of America, got started in pro-life activism in the 1990s, she held signs depicting aborted fetuses outside abortion clinics. The premise of this notoriously confrontational approach was that to see a fetus&rsquo;s fingers and toes, or its tiny profile, would provoke a kind of awakening: This can&rsquo;t be just a &ldquo;clump of cells,&rdquo; to borrow from pro-choice rhetoric, because it looks just like a baby. Today, though, ultrasound images&mdash;including incredibly precise three-dimensional sonograms&mdash;are widely available and shared heavily on social media.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The millennial generation has had access to the womb,&rdquo; Whittington said. &ldquo;A lot of young people have seen those images, and realize that there&rsquo;s a baby, and it&rsquo;s a human being.&rdquo; On college campuses, according to Whittington, many pro-choice students acknowledge that the fetus is a form of human life&mdash;even if they believe the mother deserves preference&mdash;or that a fetus exists on a kind of continuum of life that still makes abortion morally acceptable within a prescribed time frame. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a nuanced discussion now,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also an increasingly nonreligious one. In her talks on college campuses, activist Kelsey Hazzard, founder of the organization <a href="http://www.secularprolife.org/">Secular Pro-Life</a>, likes to point out that millennials are both the <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/07/the-pro-life-generation-abortion-wont-be-around-long-if-young-americans-have-a-say/">&ldquo;pro-life generation&rdquo;</a> and the least religious generation. The 2013 Pew survey showed that 25 percent of nonreligious Americans <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/15/abortion-viewed-in-moral-terms/">believe</a> having an abortion is morally wrong; as the nonreligious population, or &ldquo;nones,&rdquo; continues to grow, the number of pro-life &ldquo;nones&rdquo; will grow, too. A 2014 Pew survey <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/unaffiliated-religious-nones/views-about-abortion/illegal-in-allmost-cases/">found</a> that 18-to-29-year-olds make up a disproportionate 39 percent of anti-abortion &ldquo;nones.&rdquo;</p>


</div>

<div class="text-13 text parbase section">

<p>But these would-be activists had trouble finding each other without church-based institutions to coalesce around, according to Hazzard, 28, who works by day as a civil litigation attorney in Naples, Florida. She started Secular Pro-Life as a student at the University of Miami, initially just as a place for nonreligious pro-lifers to connect online. Although Christian churches served as convenient organizational bases for the first decades of activism in the post&ndash;<em>Roe v. Wade</em> era, those spaces can be alienating to nonbelievers who might be otherwise sympathetic to the anti-abortion message. Hazzard sees the internet as an alternative infrastructure for the next generation of pro-life activists, who have different moral assumptions and different political concerns than the old-school Christian right. &ldquo;We've been in the process over the last five to 10 years of a baton-passing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think as that process continues, and particularly as people drop the same-sex marriage issue&mdash;please&mdash;and focus on life issues, that will be the cultural shift.&rdquo; That shift involves a pivot to &ldquo;human rights arguments&rdquo; as opposed to Bible-based ones, she says.</p>

<p>Maria Oswalt, a 22-year-old senior at the University of Alabama who leads the campus&rsquo; Students for Life chapter, gets frustrated when pro-life advocates vocally oppose, say, transgender bathroom bills&mdash;the kind of issue that she sees as having no inherent connection to abortion and that serves only to make the movement look intolerant. Her Students for Life chapter focuses on abortion, but it also opposes the death penalty and assisted suicide; Oswalt sees these issues as naturally connected to abortion in a way that gender and sexuality are not. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just focus on life issues, and not try to pull these other nonrelated issues into it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>As Murphy and others told me, moral consistency matters a great deal to their younger compatriots in the movement, whose pro-life ethic means concern for life &ldquo;from womb to tomb.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a partisan issue, it&rsquo;s not a religious issue,&rdquo; Murphy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a human rights issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One stereotype of the pro-life movement is that it is dominated by men, and old men at that. Last year, when the popular conservative site Newsmax compiled a <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/pro-life-advocates-influential/2015/11/04/id/700495/">list</a> of the Top 100 most influential pro-life advocates, only five of the Top 20 were female, and one of those was the soon-to-pass-away Phyllis Schlafly. But that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/a-feminine-face-for-the-anti-abortion-movement/2011/11/02/gIQAwd7kiM_story.html">starting to change</a>. There&rsquo;s Kristan Hawkins, the 31-year-old president of Students for Life of America. Lila Rose, now 28, is the founder of Live Action, a brash organization that has produced several news-making expos&eacute;s of Planned Parenthood; Rose is now arguably the most famous young pro-lifer in America. (David Daleiden, the 27-year-old who filmed last year&rsquo;s undercover video of a Planned Parenthood executive discussing tissue donation, got his start at Live Action.) The Susan B. Anthony List, Concerned Women for America, and the National Right to Life Committee are among the other prominent groups led by women. Many of the campus leaders and other young activists I spoke with are women.</p>


</div>

<div class="text parbase text-18 section">

<p>Women aren&rsquo;t just leading the next generation of the pro-life movement&mdash;many of them are doing it using the language of feminism, which would have been anathema to the old guard of pro-life activists. If you believe, as sociologist Kristin Luker <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520055971">suggested</a> in her influential 1984 book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520055977/?tag=slatmaga-20">Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood</a></em>, that opposing abortion is really just a stealthy way of controlling women, the notion of an anti-abortion feminism will sound either absurd or morally outrageous. But the idea that pro-lifers are simply out to oppress women was always an oversimplification, and it&rsquo;s especially imprecise as a description of the next generation of activists.</p>

<p>Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, who is 33 and lives in Dallas, does not fit the stereotype of a pro-life activist: She has neon pink hair, and she calls activists who use graphic posters of aborted fetuses &ldquo;the turd in the Kool-Aid.&rdquo; She founded <a href="http://www.newwavefeminists.com/">New Wave Feminists</a> in 2007 because she &ldquo;wanted to see a change not only in the feminist movement, but in the pro-life movement.&rdquo; Herndon-De La Rosa wants to smash the patriarchy, but she sees it in unexpected places: in &ldquo;douchebags&rdquo; who &ldquo;treat fertility like a disease&rdquo; by expecting their partners to be on chemical birth control and to get an abortion if they do get pregnant, for example. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how more radical feminists don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Murphy likes to say that the future of the pro-life movement is feminist, and the future of the feminist movement is pro-life. &ldquo;I see this movement going in a direction that is a lot more women-centered,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are we doing to help women in need? What are we doing to empower women? What are we doing to promote equality among all persons?&rdquo; The fact that women are expected to bear the consequences of pregnancy alone, and that pregnancy often seems incompatible with success, is &ldquo;a grave form of injustice that we are passing on to women,&rdquo; she said.</p>

Like the Black Lives Matter movement, she says, the pro-life cause is fundamentally about protecting a vulnerable population. &ldquo;I really want to be able to reach the African American community with a message of life as a human rights issue and a civil rights issue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is a message that appeals to African Americans because we know what it&rsquo;s like to be victimized, to be looked down upon.&rdquo; At the same time, she questions the motives and sincerity of some pro-life activists who have appropriated the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter.

<p>&ldquo;When you consider what pro-lifers believe abortion is, which is essentially the systematic killing of millions of children every year, that&rsquo;s an issue of some national importance,&rdquo; said Long, the co-president of Harvard Right to Life. &ldquo;If Clinton gets this nomination, you know that essentially our generation is not going to fix <em>Roe v.

<p>Many of the activists and voters I spoke with feel a visceral disgust toward the Republican nominee. Many told me that abortion is important to them because they believe all human life is valuable; this idea is not one that fits with Trump&rsquo;s worldview. Long&rsquo;s co-president, Maria McLaughlin, says she abhors Trump&rsquo;s obsession with building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; Herndon-De La Rosa is appalled by his misogyny. Trump may have &ldquo;converted&rdquo; to being pro-life, many activists told me, but as Hazzard puts it, &ldquo;tying the pro-life brand to the Trump brand is just totally incompatible and disastrous. Anyone who has supported Trump or even been silent on the matter is going to have no credibility going forward, particularly among young people.&rdquo; Secular Pro-Life broke from its own tradition and denounced Trump in the primaries, a condemnation it has not revoked in the general election.</p>

<p>Still, few young pro-lifers I spoke to felt comfortable voting for Hillary Clinton.

The Democratic platform adopted at the convention in July is more <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/philadelphia-pro-life-democrats-mourn-their-partys-inreasingly-pro-abortion-rights-">strongly in favor of abortion rights</a> than ever. That makes the Republican Party the only quasi-reasonable place for committed pro-life voters. &ldquo;There are a lot of times I wish the Democrats would give up their dogged and relentless support for abortion,&rdquo; Matt Yonke, the assistant communications director of the Pro-Life Action League, told me by email. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;d be surprised how many people might switch parties if it weren&rsquo;t for this issue.

With the recent legislative and judicial setbacks, however, many in the &ldquo;pro-life generation&rdquo; find themselves wondering whether politics are even going to be their path to victory. &ldquo;The pro-life message is not about who&rsquo;s president or about legislation; it&rsquo;s about cultural change,&rdquo; Herndon-De La Rosa said. &ldquo;If we can learn anything from the LGBTQ movement, they changed the culture and the laws followed. ... Ultimately abortion is going to be the same thing. We have to humanize the child. People have to understand this is a human being with their own bodily autonomy.&rdquo; That argument is, she stressed, &ldquo;completely a feminist message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whittington looks back further in history for inspiration. She mentions <em>Buck v. Bell</em>, a 1927 Supreme Court case that ruled that compulsory sterilization of the &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; was constitutional; it has never been overturned, although the practice is now rightly viewed as repugnant. Whittington sees a lesson there: A movement doesn&rsquo;t need to change the law if it can change enough people&rsquo;s minds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re ever going to overturn <em>Roe v.
