		<p><i><font face="Nyala" size="4">This essay is a lightly edited 
		transcript of a series of posts I made to the Shen news group in the 
		middle of 2015.&nbsp; They highlighted the failure of the open source 
		initiative in the project, analysed the reasons and suggested a 
		successful formula for moving the project forward.&nbsp; The posts led 
		to the formation of the much more dynamic closed source Shen Professional.&nbsp; 
		The lessons here are widely applicable to many open source projects and 
		developers may find the material interesting.</font></i></p>
		<p><font face="Nyala" size="5">Evaluating the Open Source Initiative</font></p>
		<p><font face="Nyala" size="4">I said that I would give the open source 
		initiative 6 months from BSD day (February 2015)before passing judgment; 
		but the 6 months is now well up. So it's time to look at what has been 
		achieved and what lessons are to be learned.&nbsp; Stay focused; what 
		follows is important.<br>
		<br>
		Six months have passed since BSD day and it is time to take stock of 
		achievements. <u>In that time the OS initiative has accomplished bugger 
		all</u>. Am I surprised? No. But even my admittedly low expectations 
		were surpassed by the non-performance of this approach. I hope that 
		we're not going to follow the Maoists of the period of the Great Leap 
		Forward - who could not accept that their unworkable ideas did not work 
		and resorted to show trials of people to explain their failure. <br>
		<br>
		Also I hope that people are not going to try to save this discredited 
		ideology from being led to the scaffold. Take heart, I am in fact only 
		executing a corpse in what I am going to say in the next messages. <br>
		<br>
		If there is a value in this period, and it can be a very substantial 
		one, it is seeing why ideas fail, which can point to the right 
		direction. We are going to take the red pill. But before moving forward, 
		the whole open source strategy must be deconstructed. <br>
		<br>
		Now I will warn you that in the next paragraphs open source is going to 
		be shredded. Why am I doing this? Just to 
		exercise an itch? No.&nbsp; In Taoism when you embark on energy 
		cultivation (qigong) you don't just put the new energy on top of what is 
		already there; the old stale, bad <i>qi</i> needs to be cleaned out. 
		Think of having to paint over a surface with lumpy old paint; you sand 
		down the surface first and then apply the new paint otherwise your new 
		paint job is screwed by the old one. So systematically I'm going to 
		remove some myths and clean out the bad stuff. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">Myth #1 Mindshare = Success</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		<br>
		Defining mindshare as popular support on chat sites and having lots of 
		users is an OS idea of success. If you define 'success' as such and that 
		is your goal, then 'mindshare is success' is a tautology. But if you've 
		graduated beyond this desire and you have other ideas of success - for 
		example livelihood - then this is one myth that needs to be busted.<br>
		<br>
		We know now that though giving people stuff for free and achieving 
		traction is not at all synonymous with being economically successful. We 
		know this because we now have examples of projects that got lots of 
		freeloaders and still struggle for money - most notoriously 
		<a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/14/heartbleed-open-source/#wdU_WSRQVZqB">OpenSSL</a>, but 
		also 
		<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/electricity-bill-threatens-survival-of-openbsd/">OpenBSD</a> and many others less well known. We also know that in any 
		project of significant size and complexity, money is needed on a regular 
		basis to pay for the kind of professional development and support needed 
		to deliver a really good product. This is the case with Shen.<br>
		<br>
		The other problem in defining success as mindshare is that this creates 
		an almost futureproof model for failure. I can think of nothing more 
		likely to fuck your mind than going for mindshare. Why? Because simply 
		the world is a very big place full of people with very small brains who 
		can barely hold one idea at a time. The nature of things is that the 
		chances of your idea conquering the world is slight. So if you're 
		building mindshare into your success model you're building 
		disappointment, heartbreak and abandonment into your success strategy. <br>
		<br>
		There is a certain character you see in the West; the sort of girl who 
		paints her nails, works at KFC and dreams of being selected for X-Factor 
		because she sang karaoke at her friend's hen night. We laugh at this 
		because we know that for her the chances of getting mindshare and being 
		the next Beyonce are slight. Everyone can dream; but when the girl goes 
		on to neglect her education and development because she's stuck on this 
		dream, then something has gone very wrong in her head. The aspirations 
		of the OS fanatic hooked on mindshare are often no more realistic than 
		the neurotic checkout girl at KFC.<br>
		<br>
		Out of all the dubious achievements of open source none has been so 
		damaging as the general promotion of this neurotic definition of 
		success. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">Myth #2: Open Source is Creative</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		<br>
		This is an odd one. Saying OS is creative is what Gilbert Ryle called a 
		category mistake and in programming we call a type error; open source is 
		no more creative than people are divisible by 2 or knowledge wants to be 
		free. Creativity is really a feature of intelligent life of which humans 
		are supposed to be exemplars. We can only talk about institutions being 
		creative to the extent that they foster and encourage creativity. 
		Universities to an extent, used to do that, but they are corporate 
		machines today; they are not creative places to work.<br>
		<br>
		OS has never really been creative in this sense for the simple reason 
		that mindshare philosophy dominates and the quickest way to achieve 
		mindshare is to copy some closed source work that has already achieved 
		it. Hence Linux, Gimp, Open Office etc. This is not to say that nothing 
		under an OS license has ever been creative; it just means that the <i>
		zeitgeist </i>of the movement does not especially reward originality.</font></p>

		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font face="Nyala" size="4">Shen simply sticks out as 
		contrary to that trend - it is original and hard to understand. So 
		immediately we should at least <b>begin</b> to question the goals of 
		mindshare in connection with Shen. In fact the coupling of Shen with 
		mindshare thinking has been nothing short of tragic in its consequences 
		for this project. I want to get stuck into specifics next. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">The Consequences of Adopting 
		Mindshare on the Development of Shen</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		<br>
		I think a lot of people in the Shen group bought into mindshare and it 
		informed a lot of their work. Greg 
		wrote to me and said that there was no future unless Shen was more widely adopted. He then 
		nobly set himself to write an open source dissertation on Shen-YACC. 
		Bruno created a wiki which I attached to the Shen front page to allow 
		people to create their own documentation. People created the Shen reddit 
		- a very mixed blessing in some ways - and Twitter was used. All these 
		are products of a generation for whom social networking via the web and 
		the philosophy of mindshare are very much intertwined. Shen needed 
		mindshare to live and thrive.<br>
		<br>
		But actually if you look at the most productive phase from 2011-2012, 
		the 'mindshare' consisted of a handful of people. You could have seated 
		us all round a table in Starbucks. Perhaps one day we need to do that.<br>
		<br>
		The philosophy of mindshare is one of heartbreak because significant 
		mindshare is hard to achieve. Hence the people here were laying up 
		trouble and disappointment for themselves. But the task was made even 
		more monumental by very strengths of Shen; the advanced type system, 
		sequent calculus and the incredible multilingual potential which 
		collectively the software community did not and still do not understand. 
		So in effect a very small group of idealistic people with hardly any 
		resources undertook to re-educate the planet. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">Giving Away Your Power<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		When this decision to educate the planet about Shen was taken, and I 
		don't say it was a conscious decision, the centre of gravity of the 
		project moved outwards and the energy was dissipated on a fruitless 
		goal. Effectively the philosophy of mindshare had redefined success. 
		Shen was in fact an outstanding success, almost a miracle; with the 
		minimum of funding, under harsh conditions, it had achieved exactly what 
		it set out to do and a small group of people had made it run under 
		nearly every major platform. But now success was redefined as mindshare.<br>
		<br>
		This is the time when reddit made an appearance. I blessed the Shen 
		subreddit because I thought that reddit was some polite ladies bookclub 
		- obviously showing my ignorance of it. It is nothing of the sort of 
		course and some of its most vicious sites like Coontown - t<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/reddit-new-content-policy-update">he reddit for 
		racists only recently closed</a> - shows what is so often like. Reddit is a 
		shit hole; and to a lesser degree so are SlashDot, and Hacker News. <br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately some members of the Shen group, imbibing the mindshare 
		poison, gave much power away to the opinions on reddit. The OS fanatics 
		relished their power to bully and shame and people used to mail me and 
		say 'You need to say something because XYZ has said such and such on 
		reddit'. I did on occasion call such people 'complete prats', but really 
		this was whack-a-mole because the supply of arseholes was unending. <br>
		<br>
		Effectively the mindshare philosophy delivered the energy and soul of 
		the project to those who had reasons to dislike it. These people were 
		stupid and could have been dismissed as such but the mindshare poison 
		had so undermined resistance that people here could not fight them. 
		These online voices represented or claimed to represent the community - 
		they were the mindshare.<br>
		<br>
		Having bowed to open source as they demanded, the group discovered 
		that these people have melted away and are not to be found. There is no 
		open source army on the march that Tycho hoped for. There never was. What 
		you had was a bunch of useless people getting their kicks out of 
		manipulating a small group of much cleverer people. It was simply a 
		power trip. The nadir was reached when two members of the open source 
		community crawled out from under their stone to conspire to expel Shen 
		from Wikipedia by announcing Shen was dead. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">Taking Back the Power<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		When you've given away your power you generally end up energetically or 
		literally 'broke' and in a dead-end. The way this project felt mid-2015. 
		You look around and ask &quot;How did I get here?&quot; and as Willi did &quot;What 
		now?&quot;. I've answered the first question and now I move to the second. 
		The short answer is:</font></p>
		<p align="center"><b><font face="Nyala" size="4">you take back the power</font></b></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Nyala" size="4">This is the first step of 
		getting things going. You let go of the strategies and mind-stuff that 
		led you to the position of helplessness and being stuck. In this case we 
		let go of the philosophy of mindshare. Success for Shen <b>is not</b> 
		mindshare.<br>
		<br>
		When we do that immediately the power returns to the centre where it 
		belongs; inside the project and to the people who made it happen. Since 
		mindshare is no longer operating, the opinions of the open source 
		community are no longer important. You don't have to give a shit about 
		them unless they have something significant to say - which, reading 
		reddit, is not often.<br>
		<br>
		Doing this puts them in the proper perspective; rather like when you 
		were a kid and there was a huge creepy figure in your bedroom. You turn 
		on the light and the huge creepy figure is your dressing gown hanging 
		up. Your mind gave it power and made it into something huge. The 
		freetards want you to believe that they are huge, powerful and you 
		cannot succeed without their approval, but actually they have no power 
		unless we developers choose to give it to them. When you realise it is a 
		mind-trick induced by the mindshare pill they dwindle to their true 
		size.<br>
		<br>
		</font><font face="Nyala" size="5">Shen is a Powertool not Designed for 
		the Average Programmer</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		<br>
		As long as people were hooked on the blue pill there was very little 
		chance of anything useful happening. The OS fanatics on Wikipedia talked 
		about Shen being dead. The smell of death around the Shen project is not 
		coming from Shen, it is coming from the decomposing body of the OS 
		philosophy based on mindshare and the faltering economics used to power 
		the project. <br>
		<br>
		Underneath Shen is amazingly dynamic, untouched and better documented 
		than in TBoS 3rd edition than it has ever been. And the OS 6 month 
		period of total failure has had its purpose; at least people are waking 
		up to something that does not work and asking 'What can we do?'. People 
		are actually questioning the central assumptions of the OS initiative. 
		The failure of the OS initiative is a time of huge opportunity for Shen.
		<br>
		<br>
		Open source philosophy is dead, last century and discredited and we 
		developers need to take back our power from it. But where do we go and 
		what do we do with that power? Well, first we must acknowledge that Shen 
		is itself hugely powerful, that potentially as a productivity tool it 
		can reap enormous benefits if rightly handled and developed, that it is 
		in many ways unique, but that being able to extract and lever that power 
		requires programming skills that most programmers do not have and never 
		will. Think of the skills needed to dogfight and pilot the F-16 to the 
		edge of the atmosphere and the skills needed to fly a family twin seater 
		under autopilot. That's the difference we're looking at between a Shen 
		programmer and the stock programmer assembling glue code and cranking 
		code generated from packages.<br>
		<br>

		Commercial Setting </font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>

		If we are looking at the commercial development of this language beyond 
		a hobbyist implementation then we are looking at an elite group. <br>

		I quote Paul Graham's famous essay, <i>
		<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Beating the Averages,</a></i> by Paul 
		Graham. This is a must-read if you haven't read it and it is a must-must 
		read for Shenturians. Several of the passages apply directly to Shen. 
		Read it because I'm only excerpting with comments here. All I've done is 
		substitute 'Shen' for 'Lisp'.</font></p>

		Leaves Open Source Behind</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		<br>
		In September 2015, after analysing the reasons why OS Shen was massively 
		underperforming, I moved my development to closed source. Since that 
		time the closed source Shen, 
		<a href="http://shenlanguage.org/professional.html">Shen Professional</a>, has developed rapidly 
		with funding from a small group of professional programmers and 
		investors. Concurrency, compiler optimisation, large file handling, HTML 
		generation, and graphics have emerged or are emerging within a 6-8 month 
		interval. We're beginning our first commercial application - a health 
		app for yoga enthusiasts. Private money and market economics worked 
		their usual magic.<br>

		</font><font face="Nyala" size="4"><br>
		I think there is a useful lesson for developers to learn from the Shen 
		project; especially when they are working at novel computing paradigms. 
		OS may not empower your project and indeed with a 
		<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/open-source-failure-is-its-greatest-success/">98% failure rate</a> is 
		unlikely to do so. As David MacIver very rightly remarked after learning
