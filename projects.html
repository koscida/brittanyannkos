								<a href="http://t9hacks.org/" target="_blank">T9Hacks</a> is a female and non-binary hackathon hosted at the University of Colorado Boulder. The mission of T9Hacks is to create a welcoming and safe place for women and marginalized students to explore hackathons. Our goal is to create opportunity for newcomers to explore a hackathon environment while learning and solving compelling problems.
							</p>
							<p>
								I founded T9hacks in 2015 and we've hosted three annual hackathons so far. I've been the lead organizer for the past three hackathons and we're planning our fourth hackathon for Fall 2018.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm incredibly proud of this outreach work and want to contuine supporting women and non-binary students in the future.
